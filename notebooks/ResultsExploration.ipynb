       "\"The Birmingham Daily Post, 1 prioe one penny, is 'pub luhed every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, end Friday mornings, at the offices, No. 38, New Street, Birmingham, and is ready for delivery to news agents at six o'clock. Arrangements have been made for the delivery of the Post to subscribers in Birmingham by eight o'clock, and we believe that all news agents will ensure its prompt delivery by that hour. The Post will be on sale in all the principal towns of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, East Worcestershire, and Salop, by seven o'clock on the mornings of publication. The price of the Dailt Post will be 5s. 5d. per quarter, or 10s. lOtf. per half year. The Saturday Evening Post, price three-halfpence, a weekly journal for the working classes, will be published every Saturday afternoon at fire o'clock, and may be obtained from all news agents in Birmingham and the district. The Daily and Saturday Evening Post are registered for transmission abroad. Three copies of the Daily Post in one cover can be sent by post for a penny, and two copies of the Saturday evening edition. It is suggested to subscribers residing at a distance, that if three neigh bours would arrange to have their copies sent under one cover, the postage would add very little to the cost of the paper. To Advertisers in the Daily Post. -We beg to inform our advertising friends that no wood engravings will be admitted into the Daily Post. The advertise ments being limited in number, and appearing in the best position in our columns, will obtain a prominence which can soarcely be enhanced by pictorial illustrations. THE BIRMINGHAM DAILY POST, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1857. NEWS OF THE DAY. As we anticipated yesterday, the Bank of England has at length acknowledged the diminished value of money, and the accession of bullion, and has reduced the rate of discount by 2 per cent. , the current rate being now 8 per cent. , although the discount houses are taking good paper at 6. The whole tendency of monetary and commercial affairs, both in this couairy and on the Contiuent, is in the direction of impaove-ment, and it is consequently by no means improbable that a still further reduction will be speedily ma lie. Commercial affairs in America are also improving. The markets are necessarily dull, from the circv jnstane that operations for the spring trade have bijen com pleted and it is yet too early for the sunu net- business. It is also too much to expect that the, fearful crisis through which the country has passed b as in its effects been entirely overcome. Confidence, ' However, is fast being recovered and the resumptio' A 0 f specie pay ments by the Banks is only another although a very gratifying indication, of the advent 0 f a better state of matters. The Board of Trade returns which were issued yesterday, are upon the whole sa tisfactory. The con dition of trade is vividly appa- ceni a the falling off during last month to the air , ount 0 f 110 i ess than £1,987,860. as compared wit , tIie same period last year. On the eleven months 0 p jjie present year there is a considerable increase. I amounts to no less than £9,161,565. Gratifying as y,i s 3 the increase is by no means in proportion to t expansion of trade during last year. Later telegrams receivi J j from Alexandria relating to Indian affairs, while t' Je y oon f5rm the glad tidings of the relief of Lucknow a nd the safety of the garrison, modify iu some measv re previous intelligence, and supply a few' additio na j particulars. The 22,000 men which the Foreign Office despatch placed under the command of Sir O JUN Campbell, lias in that of the Times dwindled down to little more than half. We are inclined to V , e ii e y e that the smaller is the correct number, consid er jng that there were only 5,000 men under Grant a nd Grkathed at Alutnbagli, and that the Commanj ,er-in-Chief marched from Cawnpore with a force somewhat numerically inferior. If the fact be so, t j, ere j 3 80me doubt about the force being amply su fficient to reduce Oude to entire subjection, even with 1U some months to come. It must not be forgotten that Oude is almost as extensive in area as Scotland h an d has a population of 3,000,000, from which our arr des have been recruited that its forest fast nesses are many that every house in every village has been ma de a fortress and that every native and every rebe j who has fled from Bengal to swell the popula tin' ,i is a mortal enemy. There is some tough work cut O' - it for our forces, we fear, before Oude is once more ■ subdued. All the telegrams refer to a series of severe aud bloody struggles which characterised the march from Alumbagh to the Residency at Lucknow-a dis tance of some seven or nine miles, which was only accomplished after six days' incessant fighting. We are now informed that our loss iu officers is four killed and forty wounded-a proportion far below that expe rienced at the assault and capture of Delhi. Not a word has been received as to our loss in rank and file, although probably it was impossible to ascertain this in time for transmission by this mail. It appeal's that the telegraphic accounts from Naples of the frightfiil casualties resulting from a series of earthquake shocks, which informed us of the dead being counted by thousands, were much exaggerated. The details which have come to hand show that, although there has been a great destruction of property and considerable loss of life, no such awful catastrophe as that before indicated has taken place. Mr. West's legal adviser has applied to the solicitor employed to lay a case before\""
