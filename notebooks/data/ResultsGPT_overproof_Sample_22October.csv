But the match will be played in England's Twenty20 World Cup Group A. It has been suggested that Ireland are prepared to field England-style players to complement Hughes, while at the same time keeping their home-field players and substitutes from the Six Nations. This is also the case.

The game for France was played on January 5. At home, in London, it was played before a half-dozen of the English side. There were three other games at the Wanken Cricket Club. At the last-minute of the first leg, an out-of-the-way first-class English side played an entertaining, and at-risk, two-Test match. This was England's first-half defeat against England. The next day, France were playing a Test match against Ireland in the United Arab Emirates. It had been described as a'stiff match', a result which would be of immediate importance in England's Twenty20 World Cup series. This was, of course, part of a deal with France to play Ireland, and not the first-class fixture of a World Cup. It will be important that the game is played as a'striking opportunity' for England. The match will be played against a team that plays a team that plays a Test game. This means that Ireland will have a much larger chance of achieving something than any other team at the World Cup. There was an early hint that England may take a gamble when they announced their intentions to be against England in the Champions League semi-finals last week.

Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards). It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back.'Otherwise, either Martin Ryan of lack Kitching would have been rested A more thorough deduction as to, Test team possibilities could then have been made. Jones is the only back on the in- jured list. Jenkins Back I Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Marun Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. But the chances are that experienced rugged, Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as Eng- land's first half-back.

It is a pity the New South Wales selection committee was not represented at the Orange match. This will probably rob Bathurst full-back. O. Kennerson, of any chance of being chosen in the New South Wales team to play Queensland in Brisbane. His tackling and long kicking were outstanding at Orange. BATHURST, Thursday. - Oriel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sydney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs. The other, which came direct from the Sydney Rugby League, was more attractive. It offers him $300 a week to play, and promises him a starting place. He has been offered a three-year contract, with the club paying the travel expenses. He is not in the best of physical condition. He hopes to arrive in Sydney early next week, and will play in the representative trial game against New South Wales on Saturday. His chances of being selected are increased by the withdrawal of two other full-backs. - S. A. R. S. L. WARD, of Castle Hill, is still unfit and will not play at Wollongong tomorrow. The game will be played on the reserve field and, because the ground is unsuitable for football, the ground is being levelled. The Wollongong team to play the Brisbane team will probably be: M. Ryan, W. J. Ryno, T. C. Smith. Three-quarters: B. Cluett, G. Fisk, L. O'Flynn. Five-eighths: S. A. R. S. L. F. Whitcombe. Half-back: T. McCue. Forwards: F. Farrell, J. Edwards, E. Gee, E. Gough, B. King, J. Dickson, S. O'Flynn, J. Sturt. Mr. F. C. Jones, secretary of the Australian Rugby League, left Sydney to-night for Brisbane, with the first official of the Australian Rugby Union, Mr. P. M. L. Walker. They will attend the match between the Brisbane team and the New South Wales team to-morrow. The Australians hope to have the result of their inspection of the Wollongong ground yesterday known to the public in Sydney to-day. It is understood that the ground is satisfactory, and that the field conditions will be as good as on the first day. The surface will be as good as it is possible to get it. It is unlikely, however, that the field will have been made to the same standard as at Brisbane, for the ground was not fully occupied by spectators. But, considering that the New South Wales team were not at Brisbane, the ground should be as good. A lot will depend on the weather, as it is quite certain that the Brisbane team will play on the reserve field. The Australian Rugby League have decided to make the field as good as possible, to give the visitors a fair chance. There will be no grandstand erected on the grandstand-free ground, but the sides will stand on the ground. If it is wet, and the ground is muddy, it may not make much difference, but if the ground is dry, and the sides are wet, it will be very bad, and the Brisbane team will be at a big disadvantage. Wollongong is having a new stand put up on the field. It is not as good as the Brisbane stand, but is a good deal better than what it was. In the absence of the grandstand, a lot of space has been given to spectators. Mr. Jones, who arrived in Sydney to-day, will have a short visit to the ground to-morrow. This visit will be the first to Wollongong by an official of the Australian Rugby League. Mr. Jones is going over to Wollongong to inspect the ground before the match. The Australian Rugby Union has arranged for Mr. Walker to have the match programme for the first match and to see that the match is played according to the rules and regulations of the Australian Rugby Union. Mr. Walker will also inspect the Brisbane ground before the match. The referee, Mr. D. M. MacLeod, who will officiate at the first match between New South Wales and Queensland, arrived at Wollongong to-day. He is now staying at the R. M. B. Hotel. Mr. MacLeod and Mr. D. G. H. White will see that the first match is played in accordance with the rules of the Australian Rugby Union. The Australian Rugby Union has had the first match made up to five goals, and will send a committee to Brisbane to see that the game is played according to the laws. This committee will comprise the representatives of the Australian Rugby League and the New South Wales Rugby Union.

But he has been on a diet of recovery and, although he has only played a couple of minutes yesterday, he is still ready to go. And he is. ready to start the Test in the Test against New South Wales, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. It is no wonder that Marun Ryan, who scored just ten runs in the match at Sydney, would find himself at half-back. He will make his debut in the Test when he meets the NSW Lightning in Perth tomorrow evening. If that is the case, then Marun Ryan has one of his very best playing times yet with his four Test runs scored and, for the most part, his legs still feel good. As the story of the Test is set, this is an exciting match for England, with an exciting Test pack and, indeed, a terrific chance for Marun Ryan to show what he is capable of. The Test against the NSW Lightning is at 9.30pm on Friday night. England will face Australia on Saturday on the field. At half-back, the team should include J. A Johnson, Jack Kitching, A. J. Risman, A. J. Newman, E. Baten, R. Ksj, F. Farrell, K. Gee, E. Owens and T. McCue. All the fullbacks in the Test will be at full-back. For the Test, there is a strong chance that Cameron Green will play for the first time in a Test match. Green was not on the last two Test matches of the week with an injury","He said the side he joined in the summer were well paid, and he wanted to stay in the area for two years to develop his game skills, which he knew could not possibly be turned into a long-term contract. He has never done anything else but play for the club where he was raised. I he was not made the No. 1 scorer in Sydney's season, he will have to work hard to find a club with a fair salary package and a strong team. It is also important that he has no bad records and a poor balance sheet to worry about, as well as being fit and healthy. I will continue to be involved in the development of the club as a manager. I should like to express my gratitude to the City of Sydney for a very good job and the players and staff at the club. It is a great honour and a great pleasure to play for this great club. I look forward to playing in Sydney for the foreseeable future. I am looking forward to getting in touch with Sydney to make further enquiries. I hope to get back to Sydney as soon as possible. -J.C.C.S.E., Sydney. -J.P.M.C.S., Brisbane. - J.M.G.C., Sydney. - A.P.S., Sydney. - D.P., Sydney. - G.C., Sydney. - H.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S.E., Brisbane. - J.P.M.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.P.M.C.S., Brisbane. - S.P., Sydney. - C.R., Sydney. - A.M., Sydney. - P.L., Sydney. - G.R., Sydney. - A.G., Sydney. - B.C., Sydney. - H.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Brisbane. - B.J., Sydney. - B.H., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Brisbane. - F.L.C., Sydney. - H.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - A.S., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - B.J., Sydney. - G.G.C., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - B.J., Sydney. - B.H., Sydney. - D.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - A.S., Sydney. - B.H., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - B.J., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - A.S., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - G.G.C., Sydney. - B.H., Sydney. - G.D., Sydney. - D.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Brisbane. - F.L.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - A.M., Sydney. - B.J., Sydney. - H.C., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S.,",BLOOM-560M,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,0.967161845191556,0.2604017216642754,-0.7307568294190717,80-99%,0.977864948164752,0.2322779490053236,-0.7624641833810888,80-99%,-0.7342994773849997,Negative Improvement,This was the first time we had spoken in English to each other,1.0,0.2903225806451613,-0.7096774193548387,99-100%,80-99%

Gus Risman is expected to play full-back and Jack Kitching will partner Ernest Ward in the centre.

Out of England's 11 forwards, only seven were fit for the Newcastle match. Fred Hughes was hoped to be available, but his ankle was still troublesome in training. Trevor Foster's knee injury eliminates his chances of qualifying for a place in the Test pack. Harry Murphy also suffered a displaced collarbone.","England defers choice of team for Test; by Tom Goodman. Final selection for England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not occur until Sunday, according to team manager Mr. Walter Popplewell. There is uncertainty regarding the participation of two of England's young forwards, Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson due to injuries sustained during the tour. Four of England's Test forwards will need to play against Newcastle on Saturday. Ted Ward will fill in as a centre in the pack to give star player Ike Owens a much-needed rest. Well players for England who will not be playing in the Newcastle game include Gus Risman Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, Tom McCue, and Ike Owens, and possibly Les White. Unfortunately, Joe Jones will not be able to play at full-back due to knee trouble. If not for this, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching could have been rested to enable closer consideration of Test team possibilities.

On his way out of the hospital he expressed himself quite dispirited about his chances. This is not likely to improve any time soon. The best hope for Hughes, as he looks forward to the Test, is that he can get back into the Test match as far as possible. This would make the position for the Test easier, for if Hughes remains at the bottom of the squad the England side would have to make some changes before the Test. We shall be hearing a lot about this during the week.' It is understood that Hughes, in the absence of a doctor, may still remain in bed some time. - - -

But the loss of both these players will not greatly affect the prospects of the Test team.
A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN HIS CAREER IN RUGBY The new opening batsman on the Melbourne side, G. W. E. Watson, is a clever left-handed wicket-keeper with a good swing. He was one of the players selected in the Under-21's to take part in the Test tour of India, against England, and is the first Melbourne player selected for the Australian side since E. H. E. Williams was selected for England in 1925, the year in which E. H. E. Williams, of Melbourne, won the Victoria Cup. He has played for Victoria at all grades, winning several prizes in the Australian championship matches.
Watson is a younger brother of Australian cricketer, S. C. E. Watson, who is a captain of the Australian team.
A MAN OF THE BACK ROADS The man selected to play in the match against England on Monday is a cricketer of the back roads of the county of Monash. He is a big heavy forward player. His club has always had a good record in the club championship matches. A. G. N. Burt was selected in the Australian team for the tour of England in 1932-33, and won the Australian shield in that year. He is the first of this year's selections who is not a member of the first-class club.
Mr. Burt was selected by the Melbourne and Geelong club to represent Victoria in the second Test match against England last season. This is his first Test.</s>","Kennerson was a big man, but a disappointment at Orange, where his tackling and long kickings were superb. He was beaten by Jack Williams. ' Two years ago the Western Bulldogs used to have a big man of Kennerson's stamp, called T. R. Kelsey. He played the first full-Test in England and was always considered an outstanding half-back. A similar record was not matched by Kennerson. At Bathurst he is looked upon as the leading half-back, though his performances during the last two seasons have been somewhat disappointing. His team-mates, at least, think he has a good future in this position. When the Bathurst representative squad were announced on Thursday the club announced that the following team would play against Sydney at the club ground to-morrow night: Full-back. J. Lewthwaite. Three-quarters. J. Williams. D. Bennett. F, Bennett. G, Curran. Half-back. J. A. Johnson. E. Bicknell. S. McIlveen. Forwards. P. Whitcombe. K. Gee. L. White. R. S. Johnson, L. McNeil. R. Kelsey. K. J. McKay. ' It will be a pleasure to see J. McIlveen, who is expected to return from a four years' tour in India to play against his former club, the Bulldogs. ' BATHURST, Saturday. - J. McIlveen, the Bulldogs half-back who played for Western Australia in the first match in India last year, has been transferred to Sydney. He has been accepted into the team at the invitation of the Western Sydney Club. J. McIlveen was a big man, and a stout tackler, but a poor ball-player. The Bulldogs had made a splendid record last year, and were placed second in the West of Australia League, but have failed to match their winning season. J. McIlveen has had his own way, however, and has accepted an offer from the Western Sydney Club, to represent Western Sydney. In Sydney J. McIlveen will be under the charge of Mr. A. C. Johnson. It is a great blow to the club, though it is believed that J. McIlveen will be able to make himself a place in the team. Mr. A. C. Johnson has been an outstanding manager of the Bulldogs team. J. McIlveen was an excellent ball-player when he played in Western Australia, but was a poor tackler. BATHURST, Saturday. - D. Bennett, Western Australia's three-quarter, who was transferred to Sydney last week, and who is expected to make a splendid debut in the Western Sydney team, to play against Sydney, has been accepted into the Sydney team. D. Bennett was a big man, who could play either as a centre or at full-back, and was a very good ball-player. He was a big favourite at Bathurst last season, and his transfer to Sydney was expected. The only players who were not accepted into the Sydney team are M. A. McMillan, G. J. McKay, and W. T. Bennett. M. A. McMillan was thought to have a fine future as a left half, but as his injuries have not yet healed satisfactorily he was unable to play in the last match in India. W. T. Bennett had a good record last year, and was thought to have a future as a half-back in Sydney. G. J. McKay was a splendid centre, but has not been able to find his place in the West of Australia League. He is a fine ball-player and a very promising centre, but the club felt it was better to have him play for the Western Sydney team. It is expected that the Sydney team will be formed to-morrow night.

The ""ladies"" were, at the beginning, a little nervous but, when the whistle blew for the start of the first quarter, they settled down to their task with all the determination and spirit that characterises every member of the team. At the end of the first quarter they were only three points behind and from then on they played with increasing confidence. The game was evenly contested. The visitors kept the visitors out of the goal until half-time. Although a goal was kicked shortly after play was resumed, the second half saw more skilful play, the ball frequently being switched from side to side with dazzling speed and accuracy. The visitors were playing good football but the home team was never in any danger. The end result, which was 13 points to 10, was a great credit to the home side. The goal that sealed the victory was scored in the last quarter and came as a fitting close to an exciting game.

Kennerson, of any chance of being chosen in the New South Wales team to play Queensland in Brisbane. His tackling and long kicking were outstanding at Orange. BATHURST, Thursday. - Oriel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sydney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs. The other was from Sydney club Sydney Knights. He is also keen to return to Bathurst. He was born in Bathurst and moved to Sydney at the age of 18. He played at school and was a student of the Queensland Academy. Oriel Kennerson was not on the NSW list for the Orange match, and his name was omitted. It is true that he did not play at Bathurst on Saturday, as he was injured in the opening- half against North Queensland. It is also true that he was injured at his last game, as he missed the last five weeks of the season, but the fact that he is in no shape to play this week, if he plays, makes the decision to select him much more difficult. The choice of a Sydney player for the Brisbane test will be made next week, by the Bathurst selectors. The Sydney club's interest in Kennerson was confirmed last night by Bathurst captain, Rob Stokes. It is expected that Kennerson will move to Bathurst next week, and be offered the Sydney club's full-back position. A spokesman for Bathurst said:'We can confirm that, at the conclusion of the session in Canberra, it was agreed by all our members to select M. John as our full-back, and we are now waiting for the club to make a decision on this matter. ""The club will provide a decision on this matter when it is made, although it is likely to be some time. ""Mr. Kennerson has had offers to play for his local club. He will also make a decision on the Newcastle test this week. If he chooses to move back to Bathurst, he will be offered his full-back position with Bathurst, and will have the opportunity to play against Queensland in Brisbane.' Kitching has been called up for the test. He had played at St Marys and at the Knights' club at Northcote, and he has also played for Bathurst. The Newcastle selection committee has agreed on his inclusion, but there are still two or three questions that must be addressed before the Newcastle decision is made. 1 The club will meet with Mr. Popplewell and his colleagues on Friday to discuss the selection of the players for the Sydney test, which is scheduled for Sunday at Newcastle. It is hoped that the Newcastle selection committee will have all the information about their players before the meeting, and that the selection committee will decide on the next step, and the selection of the squad for Brisbane, by the club's representative. Mr. Popplewell said he has spoken to all of the Newcastle players and his colleagues about the selection process. He hopes that a decision will be made by the Newcastle selection committee on Sunday, the first day of their meeting. However, there are several questions that must be addressed before a decision can be made on the Newcastle selection. It would not be the first time that the Newcastle team have been given their final selection before a game. Since the introduction of full-back coach Geoff Eade in the summer of 1996, Newcastle have been drawn at home in the third round of the competition, and the Newcastle players have been given a chance to represent their club. In both previous seasons, the Newcastle players have been selected against Sydney and Melbourne in the three rounds, so it would not be surprising if the Newcastle players make a decision before Sunday night. It is also probable that the Newcastle team will play in Brisbane, and that the Newcastle players will play against NSW at Brisbane, in a similar manner to the Newcastle team played in 1996 against Melbourne, as in Brisbane. NSW will be on the right side of the field at Newcastle. It is therefore difficult to believe that Newcastle will be at home. If they played at Newcastle, they would be expected to win, which would be surprising. It is also probable that the Newcastle team would play against New South Wales at Sydney, in a similar manner to the Newcastle team played in 1996, as in Brisbane. NSW will be on the right side of the field at Newcastle. It is therefore difficult to believe that Newcastle will be at home.

The fact that only seven of the eleven chosen against New South Wales are fit, makes it certain that Tom Jones will get a start against Australia. Jones is on the eve of a magnificent season and with his tremendous ability to turn defence into attack he is the first choice. This makes it likely that, although Gus Risman may retain his place in the back row, as there are no injuries to be considered in that department, Ryan will be moved to full-back with McCue in the centres. The two wing positions will have to be settled when the two reserves come into consideration. If no replacements are needed, Ryan is certain to play, with George 'Farrell and Ernest Ward in the two wing spots. If England's reserves have to play in the Newcastle match, they will be: Jack W. Kitching, centre, J. Jorsenson, right wing and Ernest Ward, left wing. The Australian team is expected to be chosen when the selection trials are over in Sydney tomorrow. The reserves will be: N.

There is no doubt that Bathurst are ready to grant Kennerson's release to a Sydney club, so that he can play a full season for Eastern Suburbs.'M. Ryan, of Melbourne, is not certain of playing tomorrow night, as he is a touch doubtful with a bad ankle. There is a chance that he might be taken out of the team. M. Ryan would prefer to be at Melbourne for the Christmas season, but, if not selected tomorrow night, will probably go to Sydney for a week's rest and a few practice games before going to Melbourne. The Melbourne coach believes he can have a lot of work with Ryan on the tour and hopes he can have him fit in time for the Tests. There was also a talk at the Brisbane camp about Joe Jones' knee. Jones went to Sydney for a consultation with specialists in the United States and will return to Brisbane today. His coach, Bob Fulton, is confident that Jones will be fit for the first Test. The captain. Jack Kitching, is still doubtful with a sore back, but may get through the game.

Final selection of England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not be considered before Sunday, the team manager, Mr. Walter Popplewell, said last night. It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able to play again on the tour. At least four of England's Test forwards will have to play against Newcastle at Newcastle tomorrow.

Ted Ward, a center, will play in the pack to allow star forward, Ike Owens, to have a well-earned rest. Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman, Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards).

It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. Otherwise, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching would have been rested. A more thorough deduction as to Test team possibilities could then have been made. Jones is the only back on the injured list.

Jenkins Back: Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team.

It would not be a great surprise if Martin Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the center. But the chances are that experienced, rugged Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as England's first half-back.

Kennerson, of any chance of being chosen in the New South Wales team to play Queensland in Brisbane. His tackling and long kicking were outstanding at Orange. BATHURST, Thursday. - Onel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sjdney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs.","looks good, though. The only problem- a bad foot is still bothering him. But in the meantime the England Test squad has returned from a series of warm-up meetings in Scotland. As you may well expect, as the week has begun, England will have had a short week off. Their training was over and the rest of the squad now takes on the competition. England have been able to meet with some confidence in some of their former internationals. Those who are qualified are now playing their last games in the Test at home. The England Test squad now begins the preparations for a series of four friendly matches against the three-times world champions, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland and the Republic of South Africa. In the first match of the series, on Saturday, the England Test squad will play against Belgium. But the first Test of the week is against the Republic of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland have just won the last Test before the Test match against England. This is a crucial fixture for the Republic because it will test their best players. The test against the Republic of Ireland is the last Test of the season in Ireland and the last one of the series for England. It is an important test and it will change the line-up for England against the Republic of Ireland. The team has just won their last two Test matches, as they lost their last one last Sunday. However, Ireland is one of the top European countries ମୂଲ୍ୟ, as a strong player, they have had an impressive run of form so far, but the team has yet to make a good impression with the Test, especially because of their inability to play well off the ball. However, in this match against Ireland, the Republic of Ireland will have a hard time doing their job.","The other to a side from Sydney and a third from Adelaide. The latter offer has made a long way towards convincing the Oriel of its commitment to Kennerson. But Kennerson召开的, will not accept a second offer from Eastern Suburbs. In an interview with the Advertiser yesterday morning, the manager of Oriel Kennerson said: 'I am not a fan of this type of move. In fact, I have not had a chance to see him. I understand that he has some problems with his foot. But the whole team is quite pleased with his move. We know that he is in a good place and that if we can get him into the position he will have a good chance of coming back and we can do this. He has no problem with his foot and we do have many players to choose from.' In the last several days there has been very little discussion about whether Kennerson had taken an interest in the Oriel, and if so, what sort of interest. The only thing that has been discussed is if Kennerson wishes to continue with the Oriel. In a recent interview, Kennerson said that the Oriel is happy to do whatever it takes to keep it alive in this way. Asked about the fact that there have been many questions about the way the Oriel has worked for Kennerson, the manager said it would have been easy for Kennerson to say it was just an excuse for the absence of the football manager. Kennerson was happy to say that in the last few weeks Kennerson had asked for permission to move back into the Oriel because he felt that the way the Oriel has worked for Kennerson was not suitable. However, Kennerson has said that he has to accept the fact that there is still a chance for Kennerson to continue with the Oriel. He is still very much involved in the Oriel. In any case, the fact that Kennerson has said that he is still interested in the Oriel is a little disappointing.
The New South Wales selection committee is now in motion and has already decided that the following are the players to be selected as the players on the basis of strength and fitness in the following order: A.

Final selection of England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not be considered before Sunday, according to the team manager, Mr. Walter Popplewell. It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able to play again on the tour. At least four of England's Test forwards will have to play against Newcastle tomorrow. Ted Ward, a centre, will play in the pack to allow star forward Ike Owens to have a well-earned rest. Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman, Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards). It is unfortunate that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. Otherwise, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching would have been rested, allowing for a more thorough deduction as to Test team possibilities. Jones is the only back on the injured list. 

Dai Jenkins, the Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days but is not in his best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Martin Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman at full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. However, the chances are that experienced and rugged Tom McCue, despite being below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as England's first half-back.

Gail McDowell, with a sore calf, is unlikely to make the trip to Newcastle, although the doctor believes he should be able to play in the Test on Monday. The selectors' opinion is that John Harness has developed a good technique on the ball, and should make a good Test start. The selectors will be very impressed with his ability to hit the ball past the mid-point. On the other hand, the selectors are concerned about the fact that he is only playing the game of football, while in the game of cricket he is in a different world, and should not be used in a Test match, nor on an international tour, until he has developed his proper technique. The selectors' opinion is, therefore, that it is in John Harness' best interests to keep the test match on the side of a tour by playing in the cricket of Australia, instead of the cricket of England. The selectors are hoping that John Harness will have time to develop his new technique at his home ground, and that he will be in the Test at the commencement of the tour. A. C. A. H. D.
The following week, the English cricket team, after a series of victories at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, will have a tour to attend. For the first time they are taking their first tour outside of Australia, and are going to the United States. England's tour begins in Philadelphia, the first of the three cities in the United States where English cricket will be played. It is a very different tour, and the British team will, of course, look to show their skill in this country. To a great extent,","The other from Westmead. He has not yet decided on any of them, and the two clubs will have to consider their chances in Brisbane before giving their final reply. He was asked last week to join the Melbourne club. The match at Victoria, to which he will have to play a part, was not a great success for him. The batting and fielding, and the ground conditions, had to be improved in a big way. But Kennerson has, without doubt, the reputation for being a hard man, a dangerous player and a clever player. He did not do particularly well at Melbourne, but his batting, fielding and running were good. There were a good few occasions when he should have been sent to the ground. But he would not, in the opinion of those who saw him at Victoria. The best thing that could be said about him is that he is, without doubt, a hard man, and a dangerous player. For many months, he has been in a very bad state, but is getting steadily better. He can, in any case, give no trouble at Bathurst, but may not be able to play at Victoria. He will make a fine half-back, and a good full-back, if he gets fit. The best thing that can be said of a player who does not want to play, is that he is a good player, and one who is, without doubt, an excellent full-back. The best thing that can be said about a player who plays hard, is that he is a hard player, and one who is a great full-back. The best thing that can be said of a player who can throw, is that he is a great full-back. The best thing that can be said of a player who can tackle, is that he is a good full-back. - ' We have not yet had a reply from the Melbourne Club, but if it comes before Tuesday, the time will be up. If no reply comes to-morrow, they are likely to play Melbourne. If they want to play them, they must play them. The best thing that can be said of a player who wants to play, is that he is a good player. THE PAGEANT RULES IN THE COURT HOUSE. - On Saturday a great pageant was held in the court house to celebrate the Queen's birthday. The pageant was conducted by Mr. George Benson, the chairman, and assisted by Mr. H. T. Brown, Mr. D. R. Parry, Mr. B. L. Richardson and Miss K. A. Parry. Mr. T. D. Smith and Miss N. T. Smith led the dancing girls. Mr. E. R. Moore conducted the drumming boys. The Pageant began with a beautiful performance by Mr. J. C. W. Moore, who led a splendidly conducted dance. This was followed by a beautiful and moving performance by Mr. T. J. Turner, Miss G. R. D. Turner and Miss C. T. Turner. The dancing girls, the drumming boys and the girls who led the pageant were very much engaged, and the whole lot formed a very pleasant and picturesque pageant. Miss N. T. Smith is in the next class, and she has been very much engaged. Miss K. A. Parry has just started, and she has been very well received by all the girls.

He is thought to be fit to play and his ankle has been greatly improved by the treatment given him by his medical attendant.</s>","In his first year at Bathurst, Kennerson was a constant threat on the line, and he was a useful breakaway player, too. His tackle on New South Wales halfback C. J. Williams, in the Orange match last Saturday, was most effective, and his kicking gave some of the best chances of the game. Oriel Kennerson was the last New South Wales fullback to play the Orange match. The New South Wales selectors must make up their minds to fill the vacancy now. The other half-backs have not shown that they have the experience to play in Australia's Test team. R. D. Phillips, at left wing, and C. G. Clayson, at right, were a disappointment. Phillips could not put in a satisfactory test in the Orange match. The best test that he showed was a good try in the first half of the third quarter. Clayson, on the other hand, gave his team some good assistance, and he should be included in the New South Wales team. It is to be hoped that his ankle will not become injured. The New South Wales selectors, to fill up their Test side, have had a look at the records of players who have been sent overseas and who have done well overseas. One of these is a young South Australian, named William J. Benson, who is a promising centre. There are many players in Australia who would play well in New South Wales and who would make a fine Test team, but the selectors must put the men who are good players first, and the other men can wait for their chance to play in the Test match.
RUSSELL JONES I ' L.S.C. BALL-PAINTING. I ' A. J. JACOBS. BATHURST, Thursday. - R. S. I Jones, an ex-South Australian cricketer who plays as a half-back in his local Rugby Union club, has come up to Bathurst to teach ball-playing and ball painting. Jones, who played for South Australia in the Australian Championship, in 1926, says that he has found his new work very interesting. He says he would have no objection to doing a tour of Australia for a number of years, and he has decided to stay in Bathurst for the coming summer. ' ' I have found that the students like the work I am doing, ' he said. ' There are three kinds of balls I use in ball-playing - the short, the long, and the long-boned - the latter being the strongest. The student gets into the habit of using them and after some time he will use them with his right or with his left hand. The ball he uses is of a heavy wood and is used in batting and bowling. The ball I use in ball painting is about nine inches across the top and three inches at the bottom. This ball is used when painting a field with colours. I have taught a number of men and boys and they are interested in the work I am doing. It is something new for them and they enjoy it.'
BATHURST, Thursday. - The new R. S. I. Jones ball-playing and ball painting classes have opened their work. These classes, which are taught in a room in the clubhouse, open on a Tuesday and on a Thursday each week. The classes are directed at those who are not interested in cricketing. The opening of the ball classes was announced by Captain R. S. I Jones in a press release. He stated that the classes, which will cost £2, will be given to men, and to those who have been out of school for a number of years. The classes are to be given from 9.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on a Tuesday and on a Thursday. The students have been divided into small groups and they have to have a certificate proving they are above the age of 14. The classes will be given to men and girls, who are interested in ball-playing. If there is a girl in the class, it is given a higher grade than that to which the boys are entitled. The classes are for those who have been out of school for a number of years. The clubs will be asked to give assistance. ' I have been in this club for two years and a half, ' said Captain Jones.

Billy Lacey of Wests has had a ' remarkable recovery after ankle trouble. He is available again. Newcastle United backs of the week in the match against Newtown were Jack Taylor and Jack Barker.
Sydney's newest footballer, Stan McCabe, who has been signed by South Sydney from the University of New South Wales, has been handed out a debut in a practice match. McCabe is a good type of half-back, being strong and a daring player. He showed his kicking ability when playing for U.N.S.W. against New South Wales in a trial last year.
There will be a full-blooded struggle at half-back when England and Australia meet on Monday. It is probable that England will select Marun Ryan as their full-back, but it is known that Australia has one or two good candidates in the same position. It may be a great day for the Test forwards if the ball is given a chance to be moved up the field, but if the game is decided by a lot of kicking and punting, the half-backs should take the honours. It is not likely that the forward play of the two teams will be decidedly spectacular, as has been the case in most of the Tests, but there is every chance for the Test forwards to prove that the game of rugby is one of the best of all the football codes.
There were not many surprises in England's selection for the Test, but it is probable that the Australian selectors will choose something different. The England team will have a new back division. In the backs there are no men who have represented England before, and","The New South Wales selection committee, which will choose the Australian team for the first test match against New Zealand in Sydney on December 27, is expected to be represented at Orange on Saturday. The New South Wales committee is composed of Mr. Harry Wellings, chairman, Mr. Tom McDonald, Mr. John C. Roberts, and Mr. J. C. Giltinan, with Mr. McDonald as vice-chairman. They will be accom- panied by Mr. D. A. Carruthers, secretary of the NSWRL, Mr. A. J. Poulton, president of the NSWRL, and Mr. Frank Beattie, president of the Australian Football League. They are also likely to be accompanied by Messrs. Tom Goodman, Tom Eustace, and A. K. Hall. It is a pity that no members of the selection committee could be present at Orange to see a good game, but in the present state of the railway service from Sydney to Orange it was impossi ble.

BATHURST, Thursday. - Oriel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sydney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs. ""I would like to go to Sydney and I have not taken a decision,"" he says, when asked to talk about his future. ""I think Sydney is a good place to play, and if it is not right I would be happy to play again at this club."" His agent, Mr. possessing knowledge of the local club, has been in contact with a number of players who would not mind playing for the ""best club in the world."" The fact that he has accepted the offer means that his career is GERMANY. He is not considered for the English side.'For the second time in the month, a player with a German nationality was selected for the South Africa series against South Africa. This was the case in the first South Africa Test. The man, named ""Martin"" by the South African media image, was chosen on the basis that he had played at Sydney last year in an injury-ridden South African side. The Australian squad of 31, playing at home for the first time since March, is led by J. Allen. The squad has been chosen from the Australian squad, who played in the Test against Australia at Adelaide last Sunday. A. W. Allen will be in Australia's squad for the South Africa Tests. If he plays, it will be because of injury. I The Englishman hopes that he will be able to play at Newcastle this year. ""I want to play,"" he says, ""because I think Newcastle is a good place to play. "" Newcastle is a club for a good team."" The Englishman is not sure how his fitness will affect his Test chances in Australia. ""There is always risk,"" he says. ""I am at a very early stage in my career, and I think that I will have to play my Test chances as they are at the moment."" When asked how he plans to play against Australia in Sydney this year, he said that the conditions in South Africa are much more demanding than England's. ""I hope that I can get there in a good condition. The conditions of the match are not that good,"" he said. The team will be drawn against Australia in three Tests, at Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. ""It is going to be a good Test,"" the Englishman said. ""We have played a lot of Test matches in Australia, and we are ready for this one."" The England coach, Mr. Popplewell, is determined to have the team's best players. ""The boys from here,"" he said, ""have a fantastic talent for playing against Australia. It is a big test, but it is important that the boys who played well in the New South Wales match, have a good Test match. "" The Australians were very good at Adelaide, and they showed their quality in their second Test match in Melbourne last weekend. The Australians are a good team. ""I hope that the boys who played well will be able to make a good contribution. "" I believe that the Australian players deserve to be in the Test Team, because they played well in the match at Adelaide. "" The Englishmen want the boys from England to play in the Test Team. They need to play well in the matches against the other teams. "" They will try to have a good test match with Australia. "" The Englishmen also believe that there are certain teams that can beat England, and the Englishmen will try to find that out."" The Englishman, who has never been to Australia, was surprised to learn about the Australian selection for the Sydney Test. ""The fact that they have been selected means that I will not be able to represent England at the Tests against Australia,"" he says, ""and I will need to wait until after the Test match. ""I have not been able to play at Newcastle for a while. "" If it is possible to play in Newcastle, it will be the right time for me to do so. "" I believe that it is the right time for me to play at Newcastle. "" The match against Australia was very good. The Englishmen deserve to be in the Test Team."" The match against Australia will be played at the Orange Ground on January 3. ""It will be a very important match,"" says the Englishman, ""for both the England and the Australian players.""

I'll go into more detail about the issue later in the afternoon but there's a lot to deal with and you can read the transcript. Here are the main points: The first time I went into the match my position was in the side. It was also during a match where I thought I'd been out-muscled by G. Smith, and to be clear it was in the middle of a ball-in-hand. I was not aware that if he made his tackle I might have hit him, so I was off the field. The second time I played the same role with the England first-half side was against New Zealand in South Africa. But the third time I played the side in England's half-back position was to replace G Smith. This time the England's second line-up consisted mainly of Ritchie (Wright), Nettleton, Ewen McKenzie and Mark Chapman. The fourth time was to add J. E. Ward, and there was also a bit of work to be done to play the same role. The seventh time was to substitute Jack Kitching. The eighth time the side was on the edge of defeat. The ninth time the England's half-back role was full-back. The tenth time I was playing the half-back role was the same as the other half-back role, for which I received a call for an interview, when the team was down to half-back, the best of whom was Gary Nesbitt- who, as you may recall, played the third line-up. The eleven other times I played the half-back role was by the captain- captain, to replace D Cocksall, and the eighth time in England's two matches I made it. The ninth time was the third time England used me on the bench. I've already mentioned it in passing. The tenth time was to substitute Mark Chapman. The eleven more times played the half-back role, when I played the whole half","segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. Otherwise, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching would have been rested. A more thorough induction as to Test team possibilities could then have been made. Jones is the only back on the injured list.

Jenkins Back 

Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Martin Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. But the chances are that experienced, rugged Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as England's first half-back. Barring accidents, the teams in the Test on Monday may line up as follows:

Only Seven Fit 

Of England's 11 forwards, only seven were fit to be considered for the Newcastle match. The Englishmen hoped that Fred Hughes would be available to take a place in the front row. Hughes found at training yesterday that his ankle was still troublesome. Trevor Foster's knee injury robs him of any chance of qualifying for a place in the Test pack. Harry Murphy, with a displaced collarbone, still has his left arm at the horizontal, supported by a splint. Bob Nicholson, with a recurrence of pleurisy, is in bed again, and it is unlikely that he will play again in Australia. Mr. Popplewell announced the following team to play against Newcastle: Full-back: M. Ryan. Three-quarters: J. Lewthwaite, J. Kitching, B. Knowelden, A. Bassett. Five-eighths: W. Davies. Half-back: D. Jenkins. Forwards: K. Gee, J. Egan, P. Whitcombe, G. Curran, D. Phillips, Ted Ward, L. White (one to be omitted).

It is a pity the New South Wales selection committee was not represented at the Orange match. This will probably rob Bathurst full-back O. Kennerson of any chance of being chosen in the New South Wales team to play Queensland in Brisbane. His tackling and long kicking were outstanding at Orange.

OVERVIEW

The new year and its first games have brought some changes to the teams that were selected for the Australia tour. The first of these changes concerns the selection of the England team. The selection committee has had to wait until Sunday, after the final round of the NRL to decide whether they should select any more players. This was a decision that the team manager had hoped to be able to make after the final round of the NRL and the Rugby League World Cup.

BATHURST, Thursday. - Onel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sjdney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs.","''I have a little something to say in defence, that has been said a good deal in this section. But the real question in this section is the fact that the Test will be played at St George's Park, a ground on the outskirts of Brisbane, which has never been a Test venue. The only place where any of the two Englishmen, Fred Hughes and Eddie Biles, could be fit was at the centre of this club, and that is the ground where they are playing the game tomorrow. If they are fit, they could be fit in to be the best team in the country. And it is hard to see why the Englishmen are so disappointed in not playing in the game when they are the champions of the country. The Englishman's complaints are not in the way in the sense that the Englishman is complaining about anything he has not done right or wrong. This is a great deal of frustration in one of the greatest footballing nations of the world and you can understand that frustration and want for a result. But the real question is what happened on Sunday at the All-England club meeting that was supposed to be a friendly between the England team and Australia. There were no injuries. I have already explained that. In the end the England players, with the exception of F. Horsfall, were full-backs. That was a mistake made in the first Test. There was some controversy and I wish there would have been a very good reaction. But the Englishmen were right to blame themselves and I think they should be correct. But I feel it is unfair for them to blame themselves. They are the ones that made the mistake. The England team was the one that made the mistake. There was no penalty taken, there was no decision, there was no referee. In a very short time after the first Test, which we are talking about, the Australian team began playing. That is why the England players were so upset.

I'll go into more detail about the issue later in the afternoon but there's a lot to deal with and you can read the transcript. Here are the main points: The first time I went into the match my position was in the side. It was also during a match where I thought I'd been out-muscled by G. Smith, and to be clear it was in the middle of a ball-in-hand. I was not aware that if he made his tackle I might have hit him, so I was off the field. The second time I played the same role with the England first-half side was against New Zealand in South Africa. But the third time I played the side in England's half-back position was to replace G Smith. This time the England's second line-up consisted mainly of Ritchie (Wright), Nettleton, Ewen McKenzie and Mark Chapman. The fourth time was to add J. E. Ward, and there was also a bit of work to be done to play the same role. The seventh time was to substitute Jack Kitching. The eighth time the side was on the edge of defeat. The ninth time the England's half-back role was full-back. The tenth time I was playing the half-back role was the same as the other half-back role, for which I received a call for an interview, when the team was down to half-back, the best of whom was Gary Nesbitt- who, as you may recall, played the third line-up. The eleven other times I played the half-back role was by the captain- captain, to replace D Cocksall, and the eighth time in England's two matches I made it. The ninth time was the third time England used me on the bench. I've already mentioned it in passing. The tenth time was to substitute Mark Chapman. The eleven more times played the half-back role, when I played the whole half","segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

would be in a position to take a seat in the pack, but he has a difficult battle to fight. His ankle was not quite healed, and the English would prefer that he do not risk his health and possibly his place in the Test eleven. It is certain, however, that he will not be at Wollongong. The question is whether he can be fit for Sydney and the game against France, if the game is not forfeited. A decision will be made by to-night's train. Australia, by the way, have no idea as to the probable line-up of the Australian team. Coach R. L. White will not make the slightest attempt to influence the selection of the Australian elevens, but will insist that his players take the field with all their best efforts. White has been in Sydney from London for the past two days, and has been given the fullest particulars of the game by the officials. If the English eleven does not play to the best of their ability, Australia will have their work cut out for them. England, after a good start in the game at Newcastle, allowed the Australians to go ahead and take a good deal of the play in the first half. This allowed the Australians to wear out their Englishmen and gain their confidence in tackling and in their defensive work. By the close of the first half the Australians had done so much work that they were beginning to think of themselves as being ahead of England and did not realise the dangers of getting a second half deficit. The second half was all Australian, as the English had no idea that they were in the game. As the two teams were shaking hands at the end of the match, the English captain, Jack Kitching, told White that he had never been more bitterly disappointed in his career. Australia's second half was all over before it began, and the second half result was in the bag before the third quarter had been completed. Kitching said that he and his fellow- players were bitterly disappointed. ""After half-time we went to sleep,"" he said. ""We had no chance. I am sorry that the players cannot have their say as to what was going on at Newcastle.""'After the",""" segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

Final selection of England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not be considered before Sunday, the team manager, Mr. Walter Popplewell, said last night. It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able to play again on the tour. At least four of England's Test forwards will have to play against Newcastle at Newcastle tomorrow. Ted Ward, a centre, will play in the pack to allow star Jack forward, Ike Owens, to have a well-earned rest. Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman, Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards). It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. Otherwise, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching would have been rested. A more thorough induction as to Test team possibilities could then have been made. Jones is the only back on the injured list.

Jenkins Back 

Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Martin Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. But the chances are that experienced, rugged Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as England's first half-back. Barring accidents, the teams in the Test on Monday may line up as follows: 

ENGLAND AUSTRALIA

                E. Ward   F. Barter

Only Seven Fit 

Of England's 11 forwards, only seven were fit to be considered for the Newcastle match. The Englishmen hoped that Fred Hughes would be available to take a place in the front row. Hughes found at training yesterday that his ankle was still troublesome. Trevor Foster's knee injury robs him of any chance of qualifying for a place in the Test pack. Harry Murphy, with a displaced collarbone, still has his left arm at the horizontal, supported by a splint. Bob Nicholson, with a recurrence of pleurisy, is in bed again, and it is unlikely that he will play again in Australia. Mr. Popplewell announced the following team to play against Newcastle: Full-back: M. Ryan. Three-quarters: J. Lewthwaite, J. Kitching, B. Knowelden, A. Bassett. Five-eighths: W. Davies. Half-back: D. Jenkins. Forwards: K. Gee, J. Egan, P. Whitcombe, G. Curran, D. Phillips, Ted Ward, L. White (one to be omitted).

CORRECTED TEXT:
In a press conference yesterday morning, the Australian selectors confirmed that the six-Test tour to England had been cancelled. No date had yet been announced, but it will be in November at the earliest. The decision has come after the New South Wales selectors were unable to come to a decision on their own. The first match was scheduled for Friday night in Sydney but was cancelled as a result of the storm. It was hoped that two more matches might take place, but now the four-Test tour will have to be cancelled. It will now be decided whether the two Tests in Adelaide should be played at all. The two remaining Tests are also in doubt. The selectors now want to ensure that players who were to feature against England can be prepared if the tour is cancelled. Some players have refused to train and some will not be available for selection until after the tour is cancelled. The New South Wales selectors have expressed a desire for Australia to play three Tests in Adelaide, but are now facing pressure from the players to change their decision.

I would suggest to place the word ""still"" at the end of the sentence before the colon. Then, it would be correct.
The colon has no effect on the placement of words. However, it separates two adjacent clauses in a sentence. It is not used for emphasis in sentences.
The word still in your example would be better placed before the colon. Then, the sentence would be:

Sacks, with a dislocated collarbone, still at fault."" It was the first time a word was given to a word with a clear meaning and I think most would agree it's correct. The word 'I' was inserted after the words 'I.' It may be that it's a word for 'like,' 'like-like,' or perhaps 'like-like-like.' Some people think 'I' refers to a person and not to a book, while others say 'I.' But if you read 'I,' you probably know that there's nothing in it that I could say. Some of the Englishmen would say that I'm just a book that I haven't used. I'm not sure I'd say 'it's a book that I don't use.' The word 'like' is a little hard to read so I can't help it, but I'm pretty sure 'like-like' is an 'A.' I'd say 'it's a good word to use' and I'd go with the 'A' and I'd stick with 'I.' The words 'like' and 'like-like' are interchangeable so it should be quite clear that 'like' and 'like-like' are in fact interchangeable. It can also be argued that the word 'like' might mean 'like-like, but also be used by someone who really likes it.' I'd have to give a second thought to the two words and it seems to me that both 'like' and 'like-like' are interchangeable. I think 'like' might be the most appropriate word. I think 'like' might mean 'likelike,' but 'like-like' may be the more appropriate word. The word 'like-like' should be replaced by 'like-like.

It is the intention of the Government that the Australian Rugby League will be used to develop a rugby league for future teams. This will not be possible with current rugby league, which only has four to six teams. The Australian rugby league could well replace the Queensland rugby league, which only has four to six teams. The Australian rugby league may also replace the Queensland Rugby League, with seven teams, which was the case at the Queensland and Sydney matches. The Queensland Rugby League is not ready for its first match with Australia until July.
There are a couple of points that I have not corrected. First, I have not changed the sentence of the third sentence from I. B., ""They did not want to play on the tour."" to I. D., ""he did not want to play on the tour"". The change of sentence is intended to express the opinion of the Government.
The second point, which is irrelevant, is the word ""or any other"". The following sentence is from the revised text of the third sentence: ""It was thought the World Rugby Conference would be held at Sydney in June or July and could play in the Test. It was decided that the Conference could be held in a place where they could play in the Test. It was decided that there would be no Rugby League games in Sydney, as there were no Rugby League teams in Australia and the World Rugby Conference is not intended for Australia's Rugby League.""
The third point is that I am not aware of the Government suggesting a revision of the text of the second sentence.
The Government is proposing a revision of the text of the second sentence of this paragraph. The reason is that the original text was intended to express the opinion of the Government. However, it may well have been taken from

Final selection of England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not be considered until Sunday, the team manager, Mr. Walter Popplewell, said last night.

It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able to play again on the tour. At least four of England's Test forwards will have to play against Newcastle at Newcastle tomorrow.

Ted Ward, a centre, will play in the pack to allow star Jack forward, Ike Owens, to have a well-earned rest. Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman, Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards).

It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. Otherwise, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching would have been rested. A more thorough deduction as to Test team possibilities could then have been made.

Jones is the only back on the injured list. Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is not in his best condition, and it does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team.

It would not be a great surprise if Martin Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. But the chances are that experienced and rugged Tom McCue, despite performing below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as England's first half-back.

Barring accidents, the teams in the Test on Monday may line up as follows:
ENGLAND: Full-back, M. Ryan; Three quarters, E. Batten, L. Cooper, E. Ward, and A. J. Risman; Centre, I. Jorsenson; Half-back, J. Kitching; Forwards, J. A. Johnson, E. Newham, T. Ward, W. Horne, T. McCue.

Of England's 11 forwards, only ; seven were fit to be considered for the Newcastle match. The Englishmen hoped- that Fred Hughes would be available to take a place in the front row. Hughes found at training yesterday that his ankle was still troublesome. Trevor Foster's knee injury robs a him of any chance of qualifying for a place in the Test pack.

Harry Murphy, with a displaced collarbone, still has his left arm at the horizontal, supported by a splint. Bob Nicholson, with a recurrence of pleurisy, is in bed again, and it is unlikely that he, will play again in Australia.

To the Editor of Sunday Times

The following article has been corrected in the text below.

Marlon Ryan will replace Tom McCue at half-back for the Newcastle clash, says manager Steve McClaren, who has made no changes to the England squad.

The England-born half-back has been absent for two weeks through injury, after struggling with a back injury during Saturday's win over New South Wales.

The 25-year-old has scored a penalty in two Tests for the Barbarians, having also been involved in the famous 2-0 win over New Zealand at home in October.

McClaren said: “We are in the right position. We are not taking any risks with Marun Ryan. He is a player we can depend on and we are just happy to have him back in.”

McClaren has made five changes to his team, with Jack Kitching, A. J. Risman and Jack White coming in for the likes of M J Walsall, Tom McCue and R. Ksj.

The Barbarians lost three of their first four Tests against England, losing two of the three by 10 points or fewer and the fourth to a 12-point win.

McClaren said: “It’s a good start for us. We had an easy time in the third Test against England, and we have now had a few more hard tests. We have come through that and I am just happy to have players here.

“We have had a few tough tests, and some difficult ones. I felt we had a good enough preparation before","I ENGLAND DEFERS'CHOICE OF TEAM FOR TEST ; By TOM GOODMAN FALLON, England's most experienced player and captain, will play in the team for the first time since he injured his knee at Canberra.

 fierce attacks on Newcastle players, and the fact that a large section of the crowd were wearing green jerseys, the colours of Newcastle, aided the formation of a large proportion of the crowd into a ""few"" who sang, shouted, and yelled throughout the match. The ""few"" were not only ""few"" in number, but ""few"" in size and weight. The ""few"" were composed largely of school boys who, while not ""few"" in number, were ""few"" in years, and ""few"" in size, but were big in heart. To this ""few"" must be attributed the fact that Newcastle lost the match, for a side made up of 19 men is better than a side of 20 made up of 20 men.

When a team is downhearted, the first point that it must make good, to get the crowd back on its side, is to score some tries. This Newcastle failed to do, and the ""few"" started to take their own part and to try to lead the crowd. They sang, sang, and sang, incessantly, but the Newcastle team, and the crowd behind it, did not catch the music, but kept on plodding as though they thought the ""few"" were being paid to sing. The Newcastle backs, especially Gus Risman, kept on moving about so slowly that they did not know where they were, and, as a result, were caught on the blind side at least twice, once by a ""few."" A crowd of about 8000 watched the game. It is not necessary to enumerate them all as they are so well known to everybody. As the game progressed the ""few"" grew in number, and became more and more vociferous. During the match the ""few"" made up the following songs: -

""We don't want any more; We don't want any more; We don't want any more; The team is going; To Queensland; To Queensland; To Queensland; We don't want any more; We don't want any more; We don't want any more; The team is going; To Queensland.""

""You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match.""

""We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match.""

""They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match.""

Burgess in Good Form
Commy. (Leeds) MONDAY, JANUARY 15, 1952
Whereas, at the rugby league match between New South Wales and Great Britain at the Sydney Cricket Grounds yesterday, Fred Hargraves, New South Wales goal-kicking fullback, in the second half of the match kicked that they went into touch in a fashion that was entirely unsatisfactory to the New South Wales selection committee;
Whereas, Edward (Ted) Brown, New South Wales forward, viciously assaulted Sandy Pearce, Great Britain half-back and Allen Batsford, Great Britain forward, in the same match;
Whereas, Harry Haywood Burgess, Leeds centre forward, in that match kicked the football so that it jumped and turned in the air, then, after the football was on the ground and not in the air and the ball was, therefore, dead, kicked the ball a second time. And whereas, in neither case was he officially warned or penalised:
The New South Wales Rugby League, by this resolution, resolves ""That both Fred Hargraves, New South Wales goal-kicking fullback, and Harry Hay- wood Burgess, Leeds centre forward, be suspended from playing representative football and/or goal-kicking duties for a period of six matches"".

Texts of the above corpus will be published on the OCR corpus site of the LDC in 2007.

\section{Conclusions}
We have shown how the recognition performance of two well-known OCR systems for printed handwritten historical text improved considerably when combining automatic transcription with manual correction. We presented an automated method for detecting errors that needs no a priori information about the handwriting of the text and is therefore suitable for all historical OCR problems. To allow a quicker access to the transcribed text, we furthermore provided an OCR-like visualization that shows where the OCR recognition process has difficulties and where manual corrections should be applied. Our approach is fully general and can be applied to any OCR corpus, and, furthermore, it is transparent with respect to how many users are involved in the process.

\section{Acknowledgements}
We thank the Linguistic Data Consortium for allowing us to publish the data from the historical OCR transcription corpus. We thank the members of the University of Paderborn and other individuals who helped us with this project.

## 27th Battalion

The 27th Battalion was formed from the 61st and 62nd reinforcements which had arrived in Egypt from Australia and joined the 8th Brigade on 23 March 1916. In Egypt, the 27th Battalion trained for almost two months before it sailed for Gallipoli on 20 June 1915. The Battalion landed at ANZAC Cove and moved to the front line on 22 July 1915. The Battalion's first offensive action was a failed attack on the Sphinx at the end of July. During the Battle of Lone Pine (6-9 August), the 27th Battalion fought as part of the attacking force. The attack was unsuccessful and the 27th Battalion suffered heavy casualties. After Lone Pine, the Battalion was involved in the Second Battle of Krithia (6-8 August).

The battalion was taken out of the line for a few days but returned to the line on 21 August. From 23 August the 27th Battalion participated in the Battle of the Nek.

But the match will be played in England's Twenty20 World Cup Group A. It has been suggested that Ireland are prepared to field England-style players to complement Hughes, while at the same time keeping their home-field players and substitutes from the Six Nations. This is also the case.

The game for France was played on January 5. At home, in London, it was played before a half-dozen of the English side. There were three other games at the Wanken Cricket Club. At the last-minute of the first leg, an out-of-the-way first-class English side played an entertaining, and at-risk, two-Test match. This was England's first-half defeat against England. The next day, France were playing a Test match against Ireland in the United Arab Emirates. It had been described as a'stiff match', a result which would be of immediate importance in England's Twenty20 World Cup series. This was, of course, part of a deal with France to play Ireland, and not the first-class fixture of a World Cup. It will be important that the game is played as a'striking opportunity' for England. The match will be played against a team that plays a team that plays a Test game. This means that Ireland will have a much larger chance of achieving something than any other team at the World Cup.

It was also announced last night that New Zealand were the opponents of the Barbarians to be staged at the MCG on November 17. The English, who have been defeated by Australia in each of the last two years, will not be represented in the international matches.

BATHURST, Thursday. - Oriel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sydney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs. The other, which came direct from the Sydney Rugby League, was more attractive. It offers him $300 a week to play, and promises him a starting place. He has been offered a three-year contract, with the club paying the travel expenses. He is not in the best of physical condition. He hopes to arrive in Sydney early next week, and will play in the representative trial game against New South Wales on Saturday. His chances of being selected are increased by the withdrawal of two other full-backs. - S. A. R. S. L. WARD, of Castle Hill, is still unfit and will not play at Wollongong tomorrow. The game will be played on the reserve field and, because the ground is unsuitable for football, the ground is being levelled. The Wollongong team to play the Brisbane team will probably be: M. Ryan, W. J. Ryno, T. C. Smith. Three-quarters: B. Cluett, G. Fisk, L. O'Flynn. Five-eighths: S. A. R. S. L. F. Whitcombe. Half-back: T. McCue. Forwards: F. Farrell, J. Edwards, E. Gee, E. Gough, B. King, J. Dickson, S. O'Flynn, J. Sturt. Mr. F. C. Jones, secretary of the Australian Rugby League, left Sydney to-night for Brisbane, with the first official of the Australian Rugby Union, Mr. P. M. L. Walker. They will attend the match between the Brisbane team and the New South Wales team to-morrow. The Australians hope to have the result of their inspection of the Wollongong ground yesterday known to the public in Sydney to-day. It is understood that the ground is satisfactory, and that the field conditions will be as good as on the first day. The surface will be as good as it is possible to get it. It is unlikely, however, that the field will have been made to the same standard as at Brisbane, for the ground was not fully occupied by spectators. But, considering that the New South Wales team were not at Brisbane, the ground should be as good. A lot will depend on the weather, as it is quite certain that the Brisbane team will play on the reserve field. The Australian Rugby League have decided to make the field as good as possible, to give the visitors a fair chance. There will be no grandstand erected on the grandstand-free ground, but the sides will stand on the ground. If it is wet, and the ground is muddy, it may not make much difference, but if the ground is dry, and the sides are wet, it will be very bad, and the Brisbane team will be at a big disadvantage. Wollongong is having a new stand put up on the field. It is not as good as the Brisbane stand, but is a good deal better than what it was. In the absence of the grandstand, a lot of space has been given to spectators. Mr. Jones, who arrived in Sydney to-day, will have a short visit to the ground to-morrow. This visit will be the first to Wollongong by an official of the Australian Rugby League. Mr. Jones is going over to Wollongong to inspect the ground before the match. The Australian Rugby Union has arranged for Mr. Walker to have the match programme for the first match and to see that the match is played according to the rules and regulations of the Australian Rugby Union. Mr. Walker will also inspect the Brisbane ground before the match. The referee, Mr. D. M. MacLeod, who will officiate at the first match between New South Wales and Queensland, arrived at Wollongong to-day. He is now staying at the R. M. B. Hotel. Mr. MacLeod and Mr. D. G. H. White will see that the first match is played in accordance with the rules of the Australian Rugby Union. The Australian Rugby Union has had the first match made up to five goals, and will send a committee to Brisbane to see that the game is played according to the laws.

If that is the case, then Marun Ryan has one of his very best playing times yet with his four Test runs scored and, for the most part, his legs still feel good. As the story of the Test is set, this is an exciting match for England, with an exciting Test pack and, indeed, a terrific chance for Marun Ryan to show what he is capable of. The Test against the NSW Lightning is at 9.30pm on Friday night. England will face Australia on Saturday on the field. At half-back, the team should include J. A Johnson, Jack Kitching, A. J. Risman, A. J. Newman, E. Baten, R. Ksj, F. Farrell, K. Gee, E. Owens and T. McCue. All the fullbacks in the Test will be at full-back. For the Test, there is a strong chance that Cameron Green will play for the first time in a Test match. Green was not on the last two Test matches of the week with an injury","He said the side he joined in the summer were well paid, and he wanted to stay in the area for two years to develop his game skills, which he knew could not possibly be turned into a long-term contract. He has never done anything else but play for the club where he was raised. I he was not made the No. 1 scorer in Sydney's season, he will have to work hard to find a club with a fair salary package and a strong team. It is also important that he has no bad records and a poor balance sheet to worry about, as well as being fit and healthy. I will continue to be involved in the development of the club as a manager. I should like to express my gratitude to the City of Sydney for a very good job and the players and staff at the club. It is a great honour and a great pleasure to play for this great club. I look forward to playing in Sydney for the foreseeable future. I am looking forward to getting in touch with Sydney to make further enquiries. I hope to get back to Sydney as soon as possible. -J.C.C.S.E., Sydney. -J.P.M.C.S., Brisbane. - J.M.G.C., Sydney. - A.P.S., Sydney. - D.P., Sydney. - G.C., Sydney. - H.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S.E., Brisbane. - J.P.M.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.P.M.C.S., Brisbane. - S.P., Sydney. - C.R., Sydney. - A.M., Sydney. - P.L., Sydney. - G.R., Sydney. - A.G., Sydney. - B.C., Sydney. - H.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Brisbane. - B.J., Sydney. - B.H., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Brisbane. - F.L.C., Sydney. - H.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - A.S., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - B.J., Sydney. - G.G.C., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - B.J., Sydney. - B.H., Sydney. - D.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - A.S., Sydney. - B.H., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - B.J., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - A.S., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - G.G.C., Sydney. - B.H., Sydney. - G.D., Sydney. - D.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Brisbane. - F.L.C., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - A.M., Sydney. - B.J., Sydney. - H.C., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - F.S.T., Sydney. - J.C.C.S., Sydney. - H.D., Sydney. - J.C.C.S.,",BLOOM-560M,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,0.967161845191556,0.2604017216642754,-0.7307568294190717,80-99%,0.977864948164752,0.2322779490053236,-0.7624641833810888,80-99%,-0.7616292264889424,Negative Improvement,"tate’s second-ranked player, while his teammates",1.0,0.2083333333333333,-0.7916666666666666,99-100%,80-99%

Out of England's 11 forwards, only seven were fit for the Newcastle match. Fred Hughes was hoped to be available, but his ankle was still troublesome in training. Trevor Foster's knee injury eliminates his chances of qualifying for a place in the Test pack. Harry Murphy also suffered a displaced collarbone.","England defers choice of team for Test; by Tom Goodman. Final selection for England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not occur until Sunday, according to team manager Mr. Walter Popplewell. There is uncertainty regarding the participation of two of England's young forwards, Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson due to injuries sustained during the tour. Four of England's Test forwards will need to play against Newcastle on Saturday. Ted Ward will fill in as a centre in the pack to give star player Ike Owens a much-needed rest. Well players for England who will not be playing in the Newcastle game include Gus Risman Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, Tom McCue, and Ike Owens, and possibly Les White. Unfortunately, Joe Jones will not be able to play at full-back due to knee trouble. If not for this, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching could have been rested to enable closer consideration of Test team possibilities. Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will make his first game since a knee injury at Canberra, but is not in his best condition. It is unlikely he will play in the Test. It is probable that Tom McCue, despite being below his best at previous games, will play as England's first half-back. The teams for Monday's Test may line up as follows: England - Full-back: M Ryan; Three-quarters: E Batten, E Ward, A J Risman, J A Johnson; Five-eighth: W Horne; Half-back: T McCue; Forwards: L Owens, N Grice.

On his way out of the hospital he expressed himself quite dispirited about his chances. This is not likely to improve any time soon. The best hope for Hughes, as he looks forward to the Test, is that he can get back into the Test match as far as possible. This would make the position for the Test easier, for if Hughes remains at the bottom of the squad the England side would have to make some changes before the Test. We shall be hearing a lot about this during the week.' It is understood that Hughes, in the absence of a doctor, may still remain in bed some time. - - -

But the loss of both these players will not greatly affect the prospects of the Test team.
A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN HIS CAREER IN RUGBY The new opening batsman on the Melbourne side, G. W. E. Watson, is a clever left-handed wicket-keeper with a good swing. He was one of the players selected in the Under-21's to take part in the Test tour of India, against England, and is the first Melbourne player selected for the Australian side since E. H. E. Williams was selected for England in 1925, the year in which E. H. E. Williams, of Melbourne, won the Victoria Cup. He has played for Victoria at all grades, winning several prizes in the Australian championship matches.
Watson is a younger brother of Australian cricketer, S. C. E. Watson, who is a captain of the Australian team.
A MAN OF THE BACK ROADS The man selected to play in the match against England on Monday is a cricketer of the back roads of the county of Monash. He is a big heavy forward player. His club has always had a good record in the club championship matches. A. G. N. Burt was selected in the Australian team for the tour of England in 1932-33, and won the Australian shield in that year. He is the first of this year's selections who is not a member of the first-class club.
Mr. Burt was selected by the Melbourne and Geelong club to represent Victoria in the second Test match against England last season. This is his first Test.</s>","Kennerson was a big man, but a disappointment at Orange, where his tackling and long kickings were superb. He was beaten by Jack Williams. ' Two years ago the Western Bulldogs used to have a big man of Kennerson's stamp, called T. R. Kelsey. He played the first full-Test in England and was always considered an outstanding half-back. A similar record was not matched by Kennerson. At Bathurst he is looked upon as the leading half-back, though his performances during the last two seasons have been somewhat disappointing. His team-mates, at least, think he has a good future in this position. When the Bathurst representative squad were announced on Thursday the club announced that the following team would play against Sydney at the club ground to-morrow night: Full-back. J. Lewthwaite. Three-quarters. J. Williams. D. Bennett. F, Bennett. G, Curran. Half-back. J. A. Johnson. E. Bicknell. S. McIlveen. Forwards. P. Whitcombe. K. Gee. L. White. R. S. Johnson, L. McNeil. R. Kelsey. K. J. McKay. ' It will be a pleasure to see J. McIlveen, who is expected to return from a four years' tour in India to play against his former club, the Bulldogs. ' BATHURST, Saturday. - J. McIlveen, the Bulldogs half-back who played for Western Australia in the first match in India last year, has been transferred to Sydney. He has been accepted into the team at the invitation of the Western Sydney Club. J. McIlveen was a big man, and a stout tackler, but a poor ball-player. The Bulldogs had made a splendid record last year, and were placed second in the West of Australia League, but have failed to match their winning season. J. McIlveen has had his own way, however, and has accepted an offer from the Western Sydney Club, to represent Western Sydney. In Sydney J. McIlveen will be under the charge of Mr. A. C. Johnson. It is a great blow to the club, though it is believed that J. McIlveen will be able to make himself a place in the team. Mr. A. C. Johnson has been an outstanding manager of the Bulldogs team. J. McIlveen was an excellent ball-player when he played in Western Australia, but was a poor tackler. BATHURST, Saturday. - D. Bennett, Western Australia's three-quarter, who was transferred to Sydney last week, and who is expected to make a splendid debut in the Western Sydney team, to play against Sydney, has been accepted into the Sydney team. D. Bennett was a big man, who could play either as a centre or at full-back, and was a very good ball-player. He was a big favourite at Bathurst last season, and his transfer to Sydney was expected. The only players who were not accepted into the Sydney team are M. A. McMillan, G. J. McKay, and W. T. Bennett. M. A. McMillan was thought to have a fine future as a left half, but as his injuries have not yet healed satisfactorily he was unable to play in the last match in India. W. T. Bennett had a good record last year, and was thought to have a future as a half-back in Sydney. G. J. McKay was a splendid centre, but has not been able to find his place in the West of Australia League. He is a fine ball-player and a very promising centre, but the club felt it was better to have him play for the Western Sydney team. It is expected that the Sydney team will be formed to-morrow night. Full-back. A. Bassett. Two-quarters. D. Davies. J. Williams. F, Bennett. P. Whitcombe. E. Hogg. L. White. F. Bennett, M. R. McMillan, G. J. McKay, W. T. Bennett. L. McNeil. Half-back. J. A. Johnson.

Full Text PAGE 13 THE LADY PLAYERS GAIN VICTORY ""Practice makes perfect,"" and with the knowledge of their capabilities, the lady players went on to defeat the ladies of the South Coast Junior Football League, last Saturday, by 20 points. The ""ladies"" were, at the beginning, a little nervous but, when the whistle blew for the start of the first quarter, they settled down to their task with all the determination and spirit that characterises every member of the team. At the end of the first quarter they were only three points behind and from then on they played with increasing confidence. The game was evenly contested. The visitors kept the visitors out of the goal until half-time. Although a goal was kicked shortly after play was resumed, the second half saw more skilful play, the ball frequently being switched from side to side with dazzling speed and accuracy. The visitors were playing good football but the home team was never in any danger. The end result, which was 13 points to 10, was a great credit to the home side. The goal that sealed the victory was scored in the last quarter and came as a fitting close to an exciting game.

It is a pity the New South Wales selection committee was not represented at the Orange match. This will probably rob Bathurst full-back. O. Kennerson, of any chance of being chosen in the New South Wales team to play Queensland in Brisbane. His tackling and long kicking were outstanding at Orange. BATHURST, Thursday. - Oriel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sydney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs. The other was from Sydney club Sydney Knights. He is also keen to return to Bathurst. He was born in Bathurst and moved to Sydney at the age of 18. He played at school and was a student of the Queensland Academy. Oriel Kennerson was not on the NSW list for the Orange match, and his name was omitted. It is true that he did not play at Bathurst on Saturday, as he was injured in the opening- half against North Queensland. It is also true that he was injured at his last game, as he missed the last five weeks of the season, but the fact that he is in no shape to play this week, if he plays, makes the decision to select him much more difficult. The choice of a Sydney player for the Brisbane test will be made next week, by the Bathurst selectors. The Sydney club's interest in Kennerson was confirmed last night by Bathurst captain, Rob Stokes. It is expected that Kennerson will move to Bathurst next week, and be offered the Sydney club's full-back position. A spokesman for Bathurst said:'We can confirm that, at the conclusion of the session in Canberra, it was agreed by all our members to select M. John as our full-back, and we are now waiting for the club to make a decision on this matter. ""The club will provide a decision on this matter when it is made, although it is likely to be some time. ""Mr. Kennerson has had offers to play for his local club. He will also make a decision on the Newcastle test this week. If he chooses to move back to Bathurst, he will be offered his full-back position with Bathurst, and will have the opportunity to play against Queensland in Brisbane.' Kitching has been called up for the test. He had played at St Marys and at the Knights' club at Northcote, and he has also played for Bathurst. The Newcastle selection committee has agreed on his inclusion, but there are still two or three questions that must be addressed before the Newcastle decision is made. 1 The club will meet with Mr. Popplewell and his colleagues on Friday to discuss the selection of the players for the Sydney test, which is scheduled for Sunday at Newcastle. It is hoped that the Newcastle selection committee will have all the information about their players before the meeting, and that the selection committee will decide on the next step, and the selection of the squad for Brisbane, by the club's representative. Mr. Popplewell said he has spoken to all of the Newcastle players and his colleagues about the selection process. He hopes that a decision will be made by the Newcastle selection committee on Sunday, the first day of their meeting. However, there are several questions that must be addressed before a decision can be made on the Newcastle selection. It would not be the first time that the Newcastle team have been given their final selection before a game. Since the introduction of full-back coach Geoff Eade in the summer of 1996, Newcastle have been drawn at home in the third round of the competition, and the Newcastle players have been given a chance to represent their club. In both previous seasons, the Newcastle players have been selected against Sydney and Melbourne in the three rounds, so it would not be surprising if the Newcastle players make a decision before Sunday night. It is also probable that the Newcastle team will play in Brisbane, and that the Newcastle players will play against NSW at Brisbane, in a similar manner to the Newcastle team played in 1996 against Melbourne, as in Brisbane. NSW will be on the right side of the field at Newcastle. It is therefore difficult to believe that Newcastle will be at home. If they played at Newcastle, they would be expected to win, which would be surprising. It is also probable that the Newcastle team would play against New South Wales at Sydney, in a similar manner to the Newcastle team played in 1996, as in Brisbane. NSW will be on the right side of the field at Newcastle. It is therefore difficult to believe that Newcastle will be at home.

Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards).

Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Marun Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. But the chances are that experienced rugged, Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as Eng- land's first half-back.

Trevor Foster's knee injury robs a him of any chance of qualifying for a place in the Test pack.'Harry Murphy, with a displaced collarbone, still has not recovered sufficiently to be considered as a third front row forward. The fact that only seven of the eleven chosen against New South Wales are fit, makes it certain that Tom Jones will get a start against Australia. Jones is on the eve of a magnificent season and with his tremendous ability to turn defence into attack he is the first choice. This makes it likely that, although Gus Risman may retain his place in the back row, as there are no injuries to be considered in that department, Ryan will be moved to full-back with McCue in the centres. The two wing positions will have to be settled when the two reserves come into consideration. If no replacements are needed, Ryan is certain to play, with George 'Farrell and Ernest Ward in the two wing spots. If England's reserves have to play in the Newcastle match, they will be: Jack W. Kitching, centre, J. Jorsenson, right wing and Ernest Ward, left wing. The Australian team is expected to be chosen when the selection trials are over in Sydney tomorrow. The reserves will be: N.

BATHURST, Thursday. - Oriel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sydney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs. There is no doubt that Bathurst are ready to grant Kennerson's release to a Sydney club, so that he can play a full season for Eastern Suburbs.'M. Ryan, of Melbourne, is not certain of playing tomorrow night, as he is a touch doubtful with a bad ankle. There is a chance that he might be taken out of the team. M. Ryan would prefer to be at Melbourne for the Christmas season, but, if not selected tomorrow night, will probably go to Sydney for a week's rest and a few practice games before going to Melbourne. The Melbourne coach believes he can have a lot of work with Ryan on the tour and hopes he can have him fit in time for the Tests. There was also a talk at the Brisbane camp about Joe Jones' knee. Jones went to Sydney for a consultation with specialists in the United States and will return to Brisbane today. His coach, Bob Fulton, is confident that Jones will be fit for the first Test. The captain. Jack Kitching, is still doubtful with a sore back, but may get through the game.

Final selection of England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not be considered before Sunday, the team manager, Mr. Walter Popplewell, said last night. It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able to play again on the tour. At least four of England's Test forwards will have to play against Newcastle at Newcastle tomorrow.

Ted Ward, a center, will play in the pack to allow star forward, Ike Owens, to have a well-earned rest. Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman, Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards).

It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. Otherwise, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching would have been rested. A more thorough deduction as to Test team possibilities could then have been made. Jones is the only back on the injured list.

Jenkins Back: Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team.

It would not be a great surprise if Martin Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the center. But the chances are that experienced, rugged Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as England's first half-back.

Barring accidents, the teams in the Test on Monday may line up as follows:

ENGLAND: AUSTRALIA: Full-back: M. Ryan, O. Parkinson

Three-quarters: E. Batten, L. Cooper, E. Ward, R. Barter, A. J. Risman, C. I. Jorgenson, J. A. Johnson, E. Newham

Five-eighth: W. Horne, P. Devery

The only problem- a bad foot is still bothering him. But in the meantime the England Test squad has returned from a series of warm-up meetings in Scotland. As you may well expect, as the week has begun, England will have had a short week off. Their training was over and the rest of the squad now takes on the competition. England have been able to meet with some confidence in some of their former internationals. Those who are qualified are now playing their last games in the Test at home. The England Test squad now begins the preparations for a series of four friendly matches against the three-times world champions, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland and the Republic of South Africa. In the first match of the series, on Saturday, the England Test squad will play against Belgium. But the first Test of the week is against the Republic of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland have just won the last Test before the Test match against England. This is a crucial fixture for the Republic because it will test their best players. The test against the Republic of Ireland is the last Test of the season in Ireland and the last one of the series for England. It is an important test and it will change the line-up for England against the Republic of Ireland. The team has just won their last two Test matches, as they lost their last one last Sunday. However, Ireland is one of the top European countries ମୂଲ୍ୟ, as a strong player, they have had an impressive run of form so far, but the team has yet to make a good impression with the Test, especially because of their inability to play well off the ball. However, in this match against Ireland, the Republic of Ireland will have a hard time doing their job.","The other to a side from Sydney and a third from Adelaide. The latter offer has made a long way towards convincing the Oriel of its commitment to Kennerson. But Kennerson召开的, will not accept a second offer from Eastern Suburbs. In an interview with the Advertiser yesterday morning, the manager of Oriel Kennerson said: 'I am not a fan of this type of move. In fact, I have not had a chance to see him. I understand that he has some problems with his foot. But the whole team is quite pleased with his move. We know that he is in a good place and that if we can get him into the position he will have a good chance of coming back and we can do this. He has no problem with his foot and we do have many players to choose from.' In the last several days there has been very little discussion about whether Kennerson had taken an interest in the Oriel, and if so, what sort of interest. The only thing that has been discussed is if Kennerson wishes to continue with the Oriel. In a recent interview, Kennerson said that the Oriel is happy to do whatever it takes to keep it alive in this way. Asked about the fact that there have been many questions about the way the Oriel has worked for Kennerson, the manager said it would have been easy for Kennerson to say it was just an excuse for the absence of the football manager. Kennerson was happy to say that in the last few weeks Kennerson had asked for permission to move back into the Oriel because he felt that the way the Oriel has worked for Kennerson was not suitable. However, Kennerson has said that he has to accept the fact that there is still a chance for Kennerson to continue with the Oriel. He is still very much involved in the Oriel. In any case, the fact that Kennerson has said that he is still interested in the Oriel is a little disappointing.

Final selection of England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not be considered before Sunday, according to the team manager, Mr. Walter Popplewell. It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able to play again on the tour. At least four of England's Test forwards will have to play against Newcastle tomorrow. Ted Ward, a centre, will play in the pack to allow star forward Ike Owens to have a well-earned rest. Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman, Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards). It is unfortunate that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. Otherwise, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching would have been rested, allowing for a more thorough deduction as to Test team possibilities. Jones is the only back on the injured list. 

Dai Jenkins, the Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days but is not in his best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Martin Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman at full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. However, the chances are that experienced and rugged Tom McCue, despite being below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as England's first half-back.

Gail McDowell, with a sore calf, is unlikely to make the trip to Newcastle, although the doctor believes he should be able to play in the Test on Monday. The selectors' opinion is that John Harness has developed a good technique on the ball, and should make a good Test start. The selectors will be very impressed with his ability to hit the ball past the mid-point. On the other hand, the selectors are concerned about the fact that he is only playing the game of football, while in the game of cricket he is in a different world, and should not be used in a Test match, nor on an international tour, until he has developed his proper technique. The selectors' opinion is, therefore, that it is in John Harness' best interests to keep the test match on the side of a tour by playing in the cricket of Australia, instead of the cricket of England. The selectors are hoping that John Harness will have time to develop his new technique at his home ground, and that he will be in the Test at the commencement of the tour. A. C. A. H. D.
The following week, the English cricket team, after a series of victories at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, will have a tour to attend. For the first time they are taking their first tour outside of Australia, and are going to the United States. England's tour begins in Philadelphia, the first of the three cities in the United States where English cricket will be played. It is a very different tour, and the British team will, of course, look to show their skill in this country. To a great extent,","The other from Westmead. He has not yet decided on any of them, and the two clubs will have to consider their chances in Brisbane before giving their final reply. He was asked last week to join the Melbourne club. The match at Victoria, to which he will have to play a part, was not a great success for him. The batting and fielding, and the ground conditions, had to be improved in a big way. But Kennerson has, without doubt, the reputation for being a hard man, a dangerous player and a clever player. He did not do particularly well at Melbourne, but his batting, fielding and running were good. There were a good few occasions when he should have been sent to the ground. But he would not, in the opinion of those who saw him at Victoria. The best thing that could be said about him is that he is, without doubt, a hard man, and a dangerous player. For many months, he has been in a very bad state, but is getting steadily better. He can, in any case, give no trouble at Bathurst, but may not be able to play at Victoria. He will make a fine half-back, and a good full-back, if he gets fit. The best thing that can be said of a player who does not want to play, is that he is a good player, and one who is, without doubt, an excellent full-back. The best thing that can be said about a player who plays hard, is that he is a hard player, and one who is a great full-back. The best thing that can be said of a player who can throw, is that he is a great full-back. The best thing that can be said of a player who can tackle, is that he is a good full-back. - ' We have not yet had a reply from the Melbourne Club, but if it comes before Tuesday, the time will be up. If no reply comes to-morrow, they are likely to play Melbourne. If they want to play them, they must play them. The best thing that can be said of a player who wants to play, is that he is a good player. THE PAGEANT RULES IN THE COURT HOUSE. - On Saturday a great pageant was held in the court house to celebrate the Queen's birthday. The pageant was conducted by Mr. George Benson, the chairman, and assisted by Mr. H. T. Brown, Mr. D. R. Parry, Mr. B. L. Richardson and Miss K. A. Parry. Mr. T. D. Smith and Miss N. T. Smith led the dancing girls. Mr. E. R. Moore conducted the drumming boys. The Pageant began with a beautiful performance by Mr. J. C. W. Moore, who led a splendidly conducted dance. This was followed by a beautiful and moving performance by Mr. T. J. Turner, Miss G. R. D. Turner and Miss C. T. Turner. The dancing girls, the drumming boys and the girls who led the pageant were very much engaged, and the whole lot formed a very pleasant and picturesque pageant. Miss N. T.

He is thought to be fit to play and his ankle has been greatly improved by the treatment given him by his medical attendant.</s>","In his first year at Bathurst, Kennerson was a constant threat on the line, and he was a useful breakaway player, too. His tackle on New South Wales halfback C. J. Williams, in the Orange match last Saturday, was most effective, and his kicking gave some of the best chances of the game. Oriel Kennerson was the last New South Wales fullback to play the Orange match. The New South Wales selectors must make up their minds to fill the vacancy now. The other half-backs have not shown that they have the experience to play in Australia's Test team. R. D. Phillips, at left wing, and C. G. Clayson, at right, were a disappointment. Phillips could not put in a satisfactory test in the Orange match. The best test that he showed was a good try in the first half of the third quarter. Clayson, on the other hand, gave his team some good assistance, and he should be included in the New South Wales team. It is to be hoped that his ankle will not become injured. The New South Wales selectors, to fill up their Test side, have had a look at the records of players who have been sent overseas and who have done well overseas. One of these is a young South Australian, named William J. Benson, who is a promising centre. There are many players in Australia who would play well in New South Wales and who would make a fine Test team, but the selectors must put the men who are good players first, and the other men can wait for their chance to play in the Test match.
RUSSELL JONES I ' L.S.C. BALL-PAINTING. I ' A. J. JACOBS. BATHURST, Thursday. - R. S. I Jones, an ex-South Australian cricketer who plays as a half-back in his local Rugby Union club, has come up to Bathurst to teach ball-playing and ball painting. Jones, who played for South Australia in the Australian Championship, in 1926, says that he has found his new work very interesting. He says he would have no objection to doing a tour of Australia for a number of years, and he has decided to stay in Bathurst for the coming summer. ' ' I have found that the students like the work I am doing, ' he said. ' There are three kinds of balls I use in ball-playing - the short, the long, and the long-boned - the latter being the strongest. The student gets into the habit of using them and after some time he will use them with his right or with his left hand. The ball he uses is of a heavy wood and is used in batting and bowling. The ball I use in ball painting is about nine inches across the top and three inches at the bottom. This ball is used when painting a field with colours. I have taught a number of men and boys and they are interested in the work I am doing. It is something new for them and they enjoy it.'
BATHURST, Thursday. - The new R. S. I. Jones ball-playing and ball painting classes have opened their work. These classes, which are taught in a room in the clubhouse, open on a Tuesday and on a Thursday each week. The classes are directed at those who are not interested in cricketing. The opening of the ball classes was announced by Captain R. S. I Jones in a press release. He stated that the classes, which will cost £2, will be given to men, and to those who have been out of school for a number of years. The classes are to be given from 9.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on a Tuesday and on a Thursday. The students have been divided into small groups and they have to have a certificate proving they are above the age of 14. The classes will be given to men and girls, who are interested in ball-playing. If there is a girl in the class, it is given a higher grade than that to which the boys are entitled. The classes are for those who have been out of school for a number of years. The clubs will be asked to give assistance. ' I have been in this club for two years and a half, ' said Captain Jones.

Billy Lacey of Wests has had a ' remarkable recovery after ankle trouble. He is available again. Newcastle United backs of the week in the match against Newtown were Jack Taylor and Jack Barker.
Sydney's newest footballer, Stan McCabe, who has been signed by South Sydney from the University of New South Wales, has been handed out a debut in a practice match. McCabe is a good type of half-back, being strong and a daring player. He showed his kicking ability when playing for U.N.S.W. against New South Wales in a trial last year.
There will be a full-blooded struggle at half-back when England and Australia meet on Monday. It is probable that England will select Marun Ryan as their full-back, but it is known that Australia has one or two good candidates in the same position. It may be a great day for the Test forwards if the ball is given a chance to be moved up the field, but if the game is decided by a lot of kicking and punting, the half-backs should take the honours. It is not likely that the forward play of the two teams will be decidedly spectacular, as has been the case in most of the Tests, but there is every chance for the Test forwards to prove that the game of rugby is one of the best of all the football codes.
There were not many surprises in England's selection for the Test, but it is probable that the Australian selectors will choose something different. The England team will have a new back division. In the backs there are no men who have represented England before, and","The New South Wales selection committee, which will choose the Australian team for the first test match against New Zealand in Sydney on December 27, is expected to be represented at Orange on Saturday. The New South Wales committee is composed of Mr. Harry Wellings, chairman, Mr. Tom McDonald, Mr. John C. Roberts, and Mr. J. C. Giltinan, with Mr. McDonald as vice-chairman. They will be accom- panied by Mr. D. A. Carruthers, secretary of the NSWRL, Mr. A. J. Poulton, president of the NSWRL, and Mr. Frank Beattie, president of the Australian Football League. They are also likely to be accompanied by Messrs. Tom Goodman, Tom Eustace, and A. K. Hall. It is a pity that no members of the selection committee could be present at Orange to see a good game, but in the present state of the railway service from Sydney to Orange it was impossi ble.

""We are a little concerned that he hasn't been able to get his arm around his hand and fingers properly since he returned to Sydney last week, but the rest of the squad will do well to let him rest before deciding on his fitness. That's as it should be, but he must get back to fitness before any decision is made on his availability. We have a little bit of a wobbly knee, I think, as well. We will do everything in our power to give the player a chance."" ""The back row is a difficult position for a back-rower, because he carries the ball very high, and his strength comes from his strength and ability to catch the ball. That is why I think the most promising player in the Test team this afternoon would be J. A. Johnson. That is because his strength comes from his strong arm and strength from his ability to catch the ball."" That is the situation Hughes is in, at the moment, which the club, under the guidance of chairman, Dr George Taggart, have called upon its senior players to step up to the challenge.

Kennerson, of any chance of being chosen in the New South Wales team to play Queensland in Brisbane. His tackling and long kicking were outstanding at Orange. BATHURST, Thursday. - Oriel Kennerson, Bathurst full-back, has had two offers to transfer to Sydney clubs, but has not made any decision. One offer was from Eastern Suburbs. ""I would like to go to Sydney and I have not taken a decision,"" he says, when asked to talk about his future. ""I think Sydney is a good place to play, and if it is not right I would be happy to play again at this club."" His agent, Mr. possessing knowledge of the local club, has been in contact with a number of players who would not mind playing for the ""best club in the world."" The fact that he has accepted the offer means that his career is GERMANY. He is not considered for the English side.'For the second time in the month, a player with a German nationality was selected for the South Africa series against South Africa. This was the case in the first South Africa Test. The man, named ""Martin"" by the South African media image, was chosen on the basis that he had played at Sydney last year in an injury-ridden South African side. The Australian squad of 31, playing at home for the first time since March, is led by J. Allen. The squad has been chosen from the Australian squad, who played in the Test against Australia at Adelaide last Sunday. A. W. Allen will be in Australia's squad for the South Africa Tests. If he plays, it will be because of injury. I The Englishman hopes that he will be able to play at Newcastle this year. ""I want to play,"" he says, ""because I think Newcastle is a good place to play. "" Newcastle is a club for a good team."" The Englishman is not sure how his fitness will affect his Test chances in Australia. ""There is always risk,"" he says. ""I am at a very early stage in my career, and I think that I will have to play my Test chances as they are at the moment."" When asked how he plans to play against Australia in Sydney this year, he said that the conditions in South Africa are much more demanding than England's. ""I hope that I can get there in a good condition. The conditions of the match are not that good,"" he said. The team will be drawn against Australia in three Tests, at Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. ""It is going to be a good Test,"" the Englishman said. ""We have played a lot of Test matches in Australia, and we are ready for this one."" The England coach, Mr. Popplewell, is determined to have the team's best players. ""The boys from here,"" he said, ""have a fantastic talent for playing against Australia. It is a big test, but it is important that the boys who played well in the New South Wales match, have a good Test match. "" The Australians were very good at Adelaide, and they showed their quality in their second Test match in Melbourne last weekend. The Australians are a good team. ""I hope that the boys who played well will be able to make a good contribution. "" I believe that the Australian players deserve to be in the Test Team, because they played well in the match at Adelaide. "" The Englishmen want the boys from England to play in the Test Team. They need to play well in the matches against the other teams. "" They will try to have a good test match with Australia. "" The Englishmen also believe that there are certain teams that can beat England, and the Englishmen will try to find that out."" The Englishman, who has never been to Australia, was surprised to learn about the Australian selection for the Sydney Test. ""The fact that they have been selected means that I will not be able to represent England at the Tests against Australia,"" he says, ""and I will need to wait until after the Test match. ""I have not been able to play at Newcastle for a while. "" If it is possible to play in Newcastle, it will be the right time for me to do so. "" I believe that it is the right time for me to play at Newcastle. "" The match against Australia was very good. The Englishmen deserve to be in the Test Team."" The match against Australia will be played at the Orange Ground on January 3. ""It will be a very important match,"" says the Englishman, ""for both the England and the Australian players."" It is not necessary that England will be in their first Test of the year. ""The England players are very good, and we hope that they can make a contribution to the test match against Australia.""

I'll go into more detail about the issue later in the afternoon but there's a lot to deal with and you can read the transcript. Here are the main points: The first time I went into the match my position was in the side. It was also during a match where I thought I'd been out-muscled by G. Smith, and to be clear it was in the middle of a ball-in-hand. I was not aware that if he made his tackle I might have hit him, so I was off the field. The second time I played the same role with the England first-half side was against New Zealand in South Africa. But the third time I played the side in England's half-back position was to replace G Smith. This time the England's second line-up consisted mainly of Ritchie (Wright), Nettleton, Ewen McKenzie and Mark Chapman. The fourth time was to add J. E. Ward, and there was also a bit of work to be done to play the same role. The seventh time was to substitute Jack Kitching. The eighth time the side was on the edge of defeat. The ninth time the England's half-back role was full-back. The tenth time I was playing the half-back role was the same as the other half-back role, for which I received a call for an interview, when the team was down to half-back, the best of whom was Gary Nesbitt- who, as you may recall, played the third line-up. The eleven other times I played the half-back role was by the captain- captain, to replace D Cocksall, and the eighth time in England's two matches I made it. The ninth time was the third time England used me on the bench. I've already mentioned it in passing. The tenth time was to substitute Mark Chapman. The eleven more times played the half-back role, when I played the whole half","segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

Final selection of England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not be considered before Sunday, the team manager, Mr. Walter Popplewell, said last night. It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able to play again on the tour. At least four of England's Test forwards will have to play against Newcastle at Newcastle tomorrow. Ted Ward, a centre, will play in the pack to allow star Jack forward, Ike Owens, to have a well-earned rest. Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman, Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards). It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. Otherwise, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching would have been rested. A more thorough induction as to Test team possibilities could then have been made. Jones is the only back on the injured list.

Jenkins Back 

Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Martin Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. But the chances are that experienced, rugged Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as England's first half-back. Barring accidents, the teams in the Test on Monday may line up as follows:

Only Seven Fit 

Of England's 11 forwards, only seven were fit to be considered for the Newcastle match. The Englishmen hoped that Fred Hughes would be available to take a place in the front row. Hughes found at training yesterday that his ankle was still troublesome. Trevor Foster's knee injury robs him of any chance of qualifying for a place in the Test pack. Harry Murphy, with a displaced collarbone, still has his left arm at the horizontal, supported by a splint. Bob Nicholson, with a recurrence of pleurisy, is in bed again, and it is unlikely that he will play again in Australia. Mr. Popplewell announced the following team to play against Newcastle: Full-back: M. Ryan. Three-quarters: J. Lewthwaite, J. Kitching, B. Knowelden, A. Bassett. Five-eighths: W. Davies. Half-back: D. Jenkins. Forwards: K. Gee, J. Egan, P. Whitcombe, G. Curran, D. Phillips, Ted Ward, L. White (one to be omitted).

It is a pity the New South Wales selection committee was not represented at the Orange match. This will probably rob Bathurst full-back O. Kennerson of any chance of being chosen in the New South Wales team to play Queensland in Brisbane. His tackling and long kicking were outstanding at Orange.

OVERVIEW

The new year and its first games have brought some changes to the teams that were selected for the Australia tour. The first of these changes concerns the selection of the England team. The selection committee has had to wait until Sunday, after the final round of the NRL to decide whether they should select any more players. This was a decision that the team manager had hoped to be able to make after the final round of the NRL and the Rugby League World Cup.

But the real question in this section is the fact that the Test will be played at St George's Park, a ground on the outskirts of Brisbane, which has never been a Test venue. The only place where any of the two Englishmen, Fred Hughes and Eddie Biles, could be fit was at the centre of this club, and that is the ground where they are playing the game tomorrow. If they are fit, they could be fit in to be the best team in the country. And it is hard to see why the Englishmen are so disappointed in not playing in the game when they are the champions of the country. The Englishman's complaints are not in the way in the sense that the Englishman is complaining about anything he has not done right or wrong. This is a great deal of frustration in one of the greatest footballing nations of the world and you can understand that frustration and want for a result. But the real question is what happened on Sunday at the All-England club meeting that was supposed to be a friendly between the England team and Australia. There were no injuries. I have already explained that. In the end the England players, with the exception of F. Horsfall, were full-backs. That was a mistake made in the first Test. There was some controversy and I wish there would have been a very good reaction. But the Englishmen were right to blame themselves and I think they should be correct. But I feel it is unfair for them to blame themselves. They are the ones that made the mistake. The England team was the one that made the mistake. There was no penalty taken, there was no decision, there was no referee. In a very short time after the first Test, which we are talking about, the Australian team began playing. That is why the England players were so upset.

I'll go into more detail about the issue later in the afternoon but there's a lot to deal with and you can read the transcript. Here are the main points: The first time I went into the match my position was in the side. It was also during a match where I thought I'd been out-muscled by G. Smith, and to be clear it was in the middle of a ball-in-hand. I was not aware that if he made his tackle I might have hit him, so I was off the field. The second time I played the same role with the England first-half side was against New Zealand in South Africa. But the third time I played the side in England's half-back position was to replace G Smith. This time the England's second line-up consisted mainly of Ritchie (Wright), Nettleton, Ewen McKenzie and Mark Chapman. The fourth time was to add J. E. Ward, and there was also a bit of work to be done to play the same role. The seventh time was to substitute Jack Kitching. The eighth time the side was on the edge of defeat. The ninth time the England's half-back role was full-back. The tenth time I was playing the half-back role was the same as the other half-back role, for which I received a call for an interview, when the team was down to half-back, the best of whom was Gary Nesbitt- who, as you may recall, played the third line-up. The eleven other times I played the half-back role was by the captain- captain, to replace D Cocksall, and the eighth time in England's two matches I made it. The ninth time was the third time England used me on the bench. I've already mentioned it in passing. The tenth time was to substitute Mark Chapman. The eleven more times played the half-back role, when I played the whole half","segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

would be in a position to take a seat in the pack, but he has a difficult battle to fight. His ankle was not quite healed, and the English would prefer that he do not risk his health and possibly his place in the Test eleven. It is certain, however, that he will not be at Wollongong. The question is whether he can be fit for Sydney and the game against France, if the game is not forfeited. A decision will be made by to-night's train. Australia, by the way, have no idea as to the probable line-up of the Australian team. Coach R. L. White will not make the slightest attempt to influence the selection of the Australian elevens, but will insist that his players take the field with all their best efforts. White has been in Sydney from London for the past two days, and has been given the fullest particulars of the game by the officials. If the English eleven does not play to the best of their ability, Australia will have their work cut out for them. England, after a good start in the game at Newcastle, allowed the Australians to go ahead and take a good deal of the play in the first half. This allowed the Australians to wear out their Englishmen and gain their confidence in tackling and in their defensive work. By the close of the first half the Australians had done so much work that they were beginning to think of themselves as being ahead of England and did not realise the dangers of getting a second half deficit. The second half was all Australian, as the English had no idea that they were in the game. As the two teams were shaking hands at the end of the match, the English captain, Jack Kitching, told White that he had never been more bitterly disappointed in his career. Australia's second half was all over before it began, and the second half result was in the bag before the third quarter had been completed. Kitching said that he and his fellow- players were bitterly disappointed. ""After half-time we went to sleep,"" he said. ""We had no chance. I am sorry that the players cannot have their say as to what was going on at Newcastle.""'After the",""" segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

Final selection of England's team for the first Rugby League Test on Monday will not be considered before Sunday, the team manager, Mr. Walter Popplewell, said last night. It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nicholson, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able to play again on the tour.

It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. Otherwise, either Martin Ryan or Jack Kitching would have been rested. A more thorough induction as to Test team possibilities could then have been made. Jones is the only back on the injured list.

Jenkins Back 

Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Martin Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. But the chances are that experienced, rugged Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as England's first half-back. Barring accidents, the teams in the Test on Monday may line up as follows:

Only Seven Fit 

Of England's 11 forwards, only seven were fit to be considered for the Newcastle match. The Englishmen hoped that Fred Hughes would be available to take a place in the front row. Hughes found at training yesterday that his ankle was still troublesome. Trevor Foster's knee injury robs him of any chance of qualifying for a place in the Test pack. Harry Murphy, with a displaced collarbone, still has his left arm at the horizontal, supported by a splint. Bob Nicholson, with a recurrence of pleurisy, is in bed again, and it is unlikely that he will play again in Australia. Mr. Popplewell announced the following team to play against Newcastle: Full-back: M. Ryan. Three-quarters: J. Lewthwaite, J. Kitching, B. Knowelden, A. Bassett. Five-eighths: W. Davies. Half-back: D. Jenkins. Forwards: K. Gee, J. Egan, P. Whitcombe, G. Curran, D. Phillips, Ted Ward, L. White (one to be omitted).

It is a pity the New South Wales selection committee was not represented at the Orange match. This will probably rob Bathurst full-back O. Kennerson of any chance of being chosen in the New South Wales team to play Queensland in Brisbane. His tackling and long kicking were outstanding at Orange.

CORRECTED TEXT:
In a press conference yesterday morning, the Australian selectors confirmed that the six-Test tour to England had been cancelled. No date had yet been announced, but it will be in November at the earliest. The decision has come after the New South Wales selectors were unable to come to a decision on their own. The first match was scheduled for Friday night in Sydney but was cancelled as a result of the storm. It was hoped that two more matches might take place, but now the four-Test tour will have to be cancelled. It will now be decided whether the two Tests in Adelaide should be played at all. The two remaining Tests are also in doubt. The selectors now want to ensure that players who were to feature against England can be prepared if the tour is cancelled. Some players have refused to train and some will not be available for selection until after the tour is cancelled. The New South Wales selectors have expressed a desire for Australia to play three Tests in Adelaide, but are now facing pressure from the players to change their decision.

Some people think 'I' refers to a person and not to a book, while others say 'I.' But if you read 'I,' you probably know that there's nothing in it that I could say. Some of the Englishmen would say that I'm just a book that I haven't used. I'm not sure I'd say 'it's a book that I don't use.' The word 'like' is a little hard to read so I can't help it, but I'm pretty sure 'like-like' is an 'A.' I'd say 'it's a good word to use' and I'd go with the 'A' and I'd stick with 'I.' The words 'like' and 'like-like' are interchangeable so it should be quite clear that 'like' and 'like-like' are in fact interchangeable. It can also be argued that the word 'like' might mean 'like-like, but also be used by someone who really likes it.' I'd have to give a second thought to the two words and it seems to me that both 'like' and 'like-like' are interchangeable. I think 'like' might be the most appropriate word. I think 'like' might mean 'likelike,' but 'like-like' may be the more appropriate word. The word 'like-like' should be replaced by 'like-like. I think 'like' means 'like-","Correct the spelling and grammar of the following incorrect text from on optical character recognition (OCR) applied to a historical document:

It is the intention of the Government that the Australian Rugby League will be used to develop a rugby league for future teams. This will not be possible with current rugby league, which only has four to six teams. The Australian rugby league could well replace the Queensland rugby league, which only has four to six teams. The Australian rugby league may also replace the Queensland Rugby League, with seven teams, which was the case at the Queensland and Sydney matches. The Queensland Rugby League is not ready for its first match with Australia until July.
There are a couple of points that I have not corrected. First, I have not changed the sentence of the third sentence from I. B., ""They did not want to play on the tour."" to I. D., ""he did not want to play on the tour"". The change of sentence is intended to express the opinion of the Government.
The second point, which is irrelevant, is the word ""or any other"". The following sentence is from the revised text of the third sentence: ""It was thought the World Rugby Conference would be held at Sydney in June or July and could play in the Test. It was decided that the Conference could be held in a place where they could play in the Test. It was decided that there would be no Rugby League games in Sydney, as there were no Rugby League teams in Australia and the World Rugby Conference is not intended for Australia's Rugby League.""
The third point is that I am not aware of the Government suggesting a revision of the text of the second sentence.
The Government is proposing a revision of the text of the second sentence of this paragraph. The reason is that the original text was intended to express the opinion of the Government. However, it may well have been taken from

The Australian Rugby League may also replace the Queensland Rugby League, with seven teams, which was the case at the Queensland and Sydney matches. The Queensland Rugby League is not ready for its first match with Australia until July.
In the revised text, the following paragraph is retained: ""They may not be the most successful teams, but they have an advantage of a better record in the competition."".

The following article has been corrected in the text below.

Marlon Ryan will replace Tom McCue at half-back for the Newcastle clash, says manager Steve McClaren, who has made no changes to the England squad.

The England-born half-back has been absent for two weeks through injury, after struggling with a back injury during Saturday's win over New South Wales.

The 25-year-old has scored a penalty in two Tests for the Barbarians, having also been involved in the famous 2-0 win over New Zealand at home in October.

McClaren said: “We are in the right position. We are not taking any risks with Marun Ryan. He is a player we can depend on and we are just happy to have him back in.”

McClaren has made five changes to his team, with Jack Kitching, A. J. Risman and Jack White coming in for the likes of M J Walsall, Tom McCue and R. Ksj.

The Barbarians lost three of their first four Tests against England, losing two of the three by 10 points or fewer and the fourth to a 12-point win.

McClaren said: “It’s a good start for us. We had an easy time in the third Test against England, and we have now had a few more hard tests. We have come through that and I am just happy to have players here.

“We have had a few tough tests, and some difficult ones.

To this ""few"" must be attributed the fact that Newcastle lost the match, for a side made up of 19 men is better than a side of 20 made up of 20 men.

When a team is downhearted, the first point that it must make good, to get the crowd back on its side, is to score some tries. This Newcastle failed to do, and the ""few"" started to take their own part and to try to lead the crowd. They sang, sang, and sang, incessantly, but the Newcastle team, and the crowd behind it, did not catch the music, but kept on plodding as though they thought the ""few"" were being paid to sing. The Newcastle backs, especially Gus Risman, kept on moving about so slowly that they did not know where they were, and, as a result, were caught on the blind side at least twice, once by a ""few."" A crowd of about 8000 watched the game. It is not necessary to enumerate them all as they are so well known to everybody. As the game progressed the ""few"" grew in number, and became more and more vociferous. During the match the ""few"" made up the following songs: -

""We don't want any more; We don't want any more; We don't want any more; The team is going; To Queensland; To Queensland; To Queensland; We don't want any more; We don't want any more; We don't want any more; The team is going; To Queensland.""

""You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match; You've won the match.""

""We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match; We're going to lose this match.""

""They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match; They're going to lose this match.""

Burgess in Good Form
Commy. (Leeds) MONDAY, JANUARY 15, 1952
Whereas, at the rugby league match between New South Wales and Great Britain at the Sydney Cricket Grounds yesterday, Fred Hargraves, New South Wales goal-kicking fullback, in the second half of the match kicked that they went into touch in a fashion that was entirely unsatisfactory to the New South Wales selection committee;
Whereas, Edward (Ted) Brown, New South Wales forward, viciously assaulted Sandy Pearce, Great Britain half-back and Allen Batsford, Great Britain forward, in the same match;
Whereas, Harry Haywood Burgess, Leeds centre forward, in that match kicked the football so that it jumped and turned in the air, then, after the football was on the ground and not in the air and the ball was, therefore, dead, kicked the ball a second time. And whereas, in neither case was he officially warned or penalised:
The New South Wales Rugby League, by this resolution, resolves ""That both Fred Hargraves, New South Wales goal-kicking fullback, and Harry Hay- wood Burgess, Leeds centre forward, be suspended from playing representative football and/or goal-kicking duties for a period of six matches"".

It is doubtful if Harry Murphy and Bob Nichol- 1 son, two of England's youngest forwards, will be able J to play again on the tour. At least four of England's Test forwards will have to play against Newcastle at Newcastle to-morrow. Ted Ward, a centre, will play in the pack to allow star Jack - forward, Ike Owens, to have a well-earned rest. Fit players who will not appear at Newcastle are Gus Risman Albert Johnson, Eric Batten, Ernest Ward, Willie Horne, and Tom McCue (backs), Ike Owens, and probably Les White (forwards). It is a pity that Joe Jones's knee trouble will prevent him from playing at full-back. ' Otherwise, either Martin Ryan of lack Kitching would have been rested A more thorough deduction as to , Test team possibilities could then have been made. Jones is the only back on the in- jured list. Jenkins Back I Dai Jenkins, Leeds half-back, will have his first game since he injured a knee at Canberra. He has been training during the past few days. Jenkins, however, is below best condition. It does not seem likely that he can force his way into the Test Team. It would not be a great surprise if Marun Ryan were to be played in the Test at half-back, as in the match against New South Wales last Saturday, with Gus Risman full-back and Jack Kitching partnering Ernest Ward in the centre. But the chances are that experienced rugged, Tom McCue, despite that he was below his best at Wollongong and Orange, will retain his place as Eng- land's first half-back.
