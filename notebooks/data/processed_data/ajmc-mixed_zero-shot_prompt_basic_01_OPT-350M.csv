But, since this is the place of discussion, let us continue it here. The reader will note that, as the Prophet said in the first chapter, ‘he who will pray the prayer of prayer for aught will be received.’ Here the reader will observe that, like the Prophet, he is not to be held in an equal dignity with the Messenger of God. He is to be received as one of the faithful who can, by the power of the Law, receive the prayers of his prayers, but is not to be held in an equal dignity with the prophet. For, as the Prophet says, ‘His prayers are not to be made on his behalf alone; he is to be treated as one of the faithful who can, by the power of the Law, receive the prayers of his prayers.’ Thus the Prophet said in the first chapter: ‘I will pray for thee, O messenger of God, that I may be received with an equal dignity with thee.’ In the second chapter: ‘I will pray for thee, O messenger of God, that I may be received with an equal dignity with thee.’ These words represent the Prophet as one of the faithful, as one who can receive prayers which are not to be made by him alone; but who is to be treated as one of the faithful who can receive prayers which are to be made by the prophet alone. So, when the Messenger of God said to the men who were near him, ‘You are not my brothers,’ as he said, ‘for I know not what you will do’, the men did not reply by prayer; nor could they accept any prayers, as it was to be done. Then, again, in the third chapter: ‘And the Lord said unto the men who were near him, You are not my brothers.’ Again, in the fourth chapter: ‘And the Lord said unto the men who were near him, You are not my brothers; for I do not know what you will do;’ and again in the fifth chapter: ‘And the Lord said unto the men who were near him, You are not my",OPT-350M,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,el,results-ajmc_mixed-facebook-opt-350m.jsonl,974,1.0,0.029411764705882353,-0.9705882352941176,99-100%,1.0,0.0,-1.0,99-100%,0.9774358974358974,0.24382384532760473,-0.7505474824822512,80-99%,-0.9070452392587897,Negative Improvement

The messenger of the sun came to the house of Ajax, and, saying, ‘Here the sun has been put out,’ he offered her succour. ‘What has happened to you!’ she said, ‘I am dead, and in heaven.’ ‘Let me go in peace,’ he replied, and, taking her in his arms, kissed her and said, ‘Thou hast been restored to me.’ Then they parted, and there she was with Ajax, who, being of the same age, had been already living there. She gave him his arm, and she kissed him. Thereupon he and Ajax parted; but they returned to the house of Ajax, and again kissed each other. They then continued to talk, and were much pleased with each other, saying, ‘I have seen him, and I know that he was dead;’ and in the afternoon they parted. Finally they came to the place where Ajax had been living; they found him dead. The messenger of the sun was astonished at this event, and said, ‘He died a dead man.’

The alternative is to take ἐπ’ uol as= ‘in my case,’ and βλέψας as epexegetic ; but this is certainly harsh. 846 f. διοίγω: cp. O. T. 1287 διοί- γειν kA6pa, and ib. 1295.—mpdyn, deeds: cp. 21. Pe ἐκκύκλημα is now pushed on through the central door. It was a small stage, but large enough to allow of Ajax being shown surrounded by some of the slaugh- tered animals. The word πράγη in 247, and the language of vv. 351 ff., show that the carnage was represented. The other plays in which Sophocles has used the eccyclema are the Antigone (1294, where see n.), and the Electra (1464 f., n.). Ajax, sitting among his victims, and meditating his own destruction, was the subject of a famous picture by Timomachus of Byzantium. Philostratus ( Vit.

But the description of the scenes we have to look upon in Sophocles’s work is not only as a picture; but also as a kind of tribute to the genius of the Greek author.
