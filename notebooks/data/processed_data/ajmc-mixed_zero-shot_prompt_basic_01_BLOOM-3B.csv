He's,"The first clause is of the same origin as the other clauses in the whole passage, but, in the last clause, the sense is quite different. It is a criticism. In all these clauses, there is the same kind of expression as in the words of the suprasegment (supr. 169, & 170). There the words μεγάλα φάτις are employed in the sense of ‘which the mighty power of rumour spreads abroad,’ while they are here used in the sense of ‘that which the mighty power of rumour spreads abroad.’ 228. σὺ] Not σώσω (supra, vi. 14). In the suprasegment the same sense is employed. It is quite impossible for σὺ to denote the idea of a person.

The form ἄκοντος is preferred over καὶ in that it is used more generally. As the passage is concerned with the opinion of the enemy, the word ἐνανοία is the better, because in the suprasegment it is used only in the sense of ‘to act in the opposite way,’ as in infr. 246. 232. τιμήν] ‘Terror.’ ὑστέρωσιν] ‘To be terrified.’ τριήν] ‘Terrible.",BLOOM-3B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,el,results-ajmc_mixed-bigscience-bloom-3b.jsonl,1219,0.9285714285714286,0.05,-0.9461538461538461,80-99%,1.0,0.21212121212121213,-0.7878787878787878,99-100%,0.9647251845775225,0.21580547112462006,-0.7763036825672518,80-99%,-0.8367787721999619,Negative Improvement

LXXIV",The text is in error.,"The same idea is taken from Soph. 4. 5, where Andromache’s father, after having been overpowered by a flood, declares to her ‘αἵτι τύχη,’ Cp. Il. 8. 2, σύνδεσμος ἠπέγκασαν. In the first half of the poem, the sense of this phrase, so widely diffused among Greeks, is, ‘to be crushed, to have no hope;’ but in the end of the work, it signifies, ‘to die, to perish.’ The word τύχη is used by Plato (Met. 427 D.2. 4) to denote, according to the expression of Cicero (De Rep. 1. 26), a ‘barren, wasteful, and unproductive space,’ which is a common and significant synonym for an empty place. The word is evidently the same as τύχην, a ‘barren’ space; and in Euripides, the sense is almost precisely the same as that of Ptol. The word τύχη occurs frequently in the Greek tragedians, as well as in the epics and histories. It is applied to many spaces, such as the interior of the house, a temple, or the garden. We shall here translate it for ‘sacrifice,’ or ‘sacrificial space,’ although the meaning is quite different. The word is also used of ‘sacrificial rites,’ which are, as we know, not only customary among the Greeks, but also part of their religion.

In the first half of the poem, the sense of this phrase, so widely diffused among Greeks, is, ‘to be crushed, to have no hope;’ but in the end of the work, it signifies, ‘to die, to perish.’ The word τύχη is used by Plato (Met. 427 D.2. 4) to denote, according to the expression of Cicero (De Rep. 1. 26), a ‘barren, wasteful, and unproductive space,’ which is a common and significant synonym for an empty place. The word is evidently the same as τύχην, a ‘barren’ space; and in Euripides, the sense is almost precisely the same as that of Ptol. The word τύχη occurs frequently in the Greek tragedians, as well as in the epics and histories. It is applied to many spaces, such as the interior of the house, a temple, or the garden.

Il. 8. 2, σύνδεσμος ἠπέγκασαν. In the first half of the poem, the sense of this phrase, so widely diffused among Greeks, is, ‘to be crushed, to have no hope;’ but in the end of the work, it signifies, ‘to die, to perish.’ The word τύχη is used by Plato (Met. 427 D.2. 4) to denote, according to the expression of Cicero (De Rep. 1. 26), a ‘barren, wasteful, and unproductive space,’ which is a common and significant synonym for an empty place. The word is evidently the same as τύχην, a ‘barren’ space; and in Euripides, the sense is almost precisely the same as that of Ptol. The word τύχη occurs frequently in the Greek tragedians, as well as in the epics and histories. It is applied to many spaces, such as the interior of the house, a temple, or the garden. We shall here translate it for ‘sacrifice,’ or ‘sacrificial space,’ although the meaning is quite different. The word is also used of ‘sacrificial rites,’ which are, as we know, not only customary among the Greeks, but also part of their religion.

Τιθέντι οὖν μέσω (“as to this”)— is more common. It is used more often than ἕως as a preposition (for instance, περὶ βρὰ τιθέντι, περὶ μέσω. τιθέντι), though it is much less common in the latter case; see also § § iii. and iv.— Ii. I. 3 θεὰν ἕως; (sc. as a neg.) i.e. θεὰν ὕστερον, cf. El. 1423 μὲν ἐγέντω (“as a question”). In ii. 2 we have the same use as in i. 3, in the sense that θεὰν καὶ ἐγέντω δὲ. ἔχουσιν τιθέντι, ἔδρασιν οὖν μέσω; ii. I. 2 θεὰν ἕως (“so as to this”), i.e. θεὰν ἔχουσιν ἔδρασιν.
