Quand je relevai la tête, l'obscurité la plus complète s'était faite dans votre logement, et une lueur d'espoir tra-versa mon esprit. Point de doute vous alliez venir, vous alliez paraître.

Pourquoi était-il là et non pas vous ? A quel titre se présentait-il ! Était-ce de votre part ? Que pouvait-il avoir à me dire ? A tout prendre, si c'était votre messager, vous aviez eu, en le choisissant, la main singulièrement malheureuse. Il faut que ma physionomie ait exprimé, en partie du moins, les sentiments qui m'agitaient, ou bien que Melchior eût préparé, en habile acteur, les nuances de son rôle. Tou-jours est-il qu'il s'en tira à son avantage et se conduisit de manière à me désarmer.

Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés.

On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. -Monsieur! s'écria-t-il, Monsieur ! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. -J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. -Votre camarade ? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous ! -Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dût-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres.

278 CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. -Plus vite, ce serait difficile nous marchons à en perdre la respiration. -Avez-vous au moins tout ce qu'il vous faut en cas d'é-vénement ? -Soyez tranquille. -Des antidotes surtout ? -Ne vous en préoccupez pas j'y ai songé d'ailleurs c'est de règle aujourd'hui. Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solûment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. -Monsieur! s'écria-t-il, Monsieur ! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication.

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solûment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. -Monsieur! s'écria-t-il, Monsieur ! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. -J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. -Votre camarade ? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous ! -Voyons, finissons-en.

Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. -Non, lui dit-il, restez. -Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? -Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Votre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une autre, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. -J'obéis alors. -Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie. Tâchez d'en venir à bout et j'incli-nerai ma science devant la vôtre. L'aimez-vous ? -Si je l'aime ! Vous me demandez si je l'aime ! Ne le voyez-vous pas ? -Eh bien ! alors, il y a quelque chance pour que vous réussissiez. Mais, ou je me trompe fort, ou ce sera une cure difficile. Cet entretien avait lieu à voix si basse, que rien n'en pou-vait parvenir aux oreilles de Marguerite, et, pourtant, il se fit chez elle un mouvement singulier. Sa main, raidie et con-ractée, se replia d'elle-même et vint se poser sur sa poi-

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solùment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. - Monsieurl s'écria-t-il, Monsieur! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. - Où allez-vous, Monsieur? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait ehez qui ils allaient. - Où je vais? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. - Comment, je le vois? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. - J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. - Votre camarade? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous 1 - Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dtlt-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

Legrand, tu prends le secteur H, dangereux pour les marmites, surtout au Bois Equerre tu suivras le boyau central jusqu'au boyau Boscary, où tu trouveras le poste de son com-mandant.

Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie.

CE QUI PEUT ÊTRE VU DANS UNE RUE. 257, j'obéisais, tant il y avait en moi de confusion et de trouble. Il faut si peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui ! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux, on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, on puise des motifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'est arrivé, Ludovic. Avant de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, mais lorsque je vous ai revu, la confiance m'a manqué. Il n'y avait ni raisonnement ni calcul, mais une force impérieuse et presque indépendante de ma volonté. Ensuite, j'ai commencé à me convaincre que je pouvais supporter ces défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons ? La chose en valait-elle la peine ? Cet homme était venu chez moi par un simple caprice, et il ne reviendrait probablement plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus facile que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs arrogants ? N'était-il pas préférable de procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, comme une femme peut et doit le faire, plutôt que de mettre deux hommes en présence et de déclencher une dispute pour un si petit motif ? Voilà les pensées auxquelles j'ai cédé sans trop réfléchir ni pénétrer dans mon cœur.

La suite ne l'a que trop prouvé j'étais déjà touchée, j'entrais dans cette série de faiblesses qui m'ont perdue. C'est ici que j'ai besoin de votre pardon, Ludovic, d'un pardon absolu et généreux. Point d'excuse possible, rien qui puisse pallier ce commen-cement de trahison. Vous aviez été pour moi le meilleur, le plus dévoué et le plus fidèle des amis vous n'aviez qu'une pensée, mon bonheur qu'un but, notre union. Jamais, c'est une justice que je me plais à vous rendre, aucun chagrin ne m'est venu de vous si j'exprimais un désir, vous vous em-pressiez de le satisfaire si j'avais un ennui, vous vous offriez à le partager. Vous étiez de ces loyaux compagnons qu'une femme est trop heureuse de rencontrer dans sa vie, qui l'as-sistent dans les bons et les mauvais jours et se donnent sans réserve comme sans calcul. Je voyais tout cela, je le sentais et ne méconnaissais point vos mérites. Lui, au contraire, qu'était-il et quel fonds

Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie. Tâchez d'en venir à bout et j'incli-nerai ma science devant la vôtre. L'aimez-vous ? - Si je l'aime 1 Vous me demandez si je l'aime!

Vous êtes sa force et son soutien. Faites-lui confiance, et faites confiance à mon traitement. Je suis sûr que vous verrez une amélioration bientôt. Ludovic suivit les conseils du médecin, et pendant les jours qui suivirent, il écarta résolument tous les pensées de culpabilité et de doute de son esprit. Il se concentra sur le soutien et le réconfort qu'il pouvait apporter à la jeune fille, et sur la confiance qu'il avait dans le traitement du médecin. Bientôt, ses efforts furent récompensés, et la jeune fille commença à montrer des signes de guérison. Cela prit du temps, mais grâce à la détermination et à la confiance de Ludovic, ainsi qu'au savoir-faire du médecin, elle finit par se rétablir complètement.

Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu.

Vous êtes le seul à pouvoir la calmer et à la rassurer. Elle a besoin de votre présence autant que de mes soins. Restez donc, et réconfortez-la. Ludovic s'inclina sans répondre, mais il sentit que sa présence avait quelque chose de rassurant pour la malade. Il lui parlait à voix basse, la berçait comme un enfant, lui soufflait de douces paroles, et elle semblait l'écouter avec un sourire aux lèvres. La camériste qui se tenait à l'écart, étonnée et admirative, voyait bien que cet homme était différent de tous ceux qu'elle avait connus jusqu'alors. Elle qui avait assisté aux efforts de tant de médecins, qui avait vu défiler des prétendants, des amis, des parents, ne tarissait pas d'éloges sur Ludovic. Elle disait qu'il avait une main miraculeuse, qu'il savait parler aux âmes, qu'il était le bienfaiteur de cette maison. Le docteur lui-même, assez sceptique de nature, voyait avec surprise les résultats obtenus par le jeune homme. Il était clair que la présence de Ludovic avait un effet thérapeutique sur la patiente. Leur relation particulière était difficile à définir, mais il était évident que quelque chose de fort les unissait. En quelques jours, la jeune fille se rétablit complètement.

Vous êtes le seul à pouvoir la calmer et à la rassurer. Elle a besoin de votre présence autant que de mes soins. Restez donc, et réconfortez-la. Ludovic s'inclina sans répondre, mais il sentit que sa présence avait quelque chose de rassurant pour la malade. Il lui parlait à voix basse, la berçait comme un enfant, lui soufflait de douces paroles, et elle semblait l'écouter avec un sourire aux lèvres. La camériste qui se tenait à l'écart, étonnée et admirative, voyait bien que cet homme était différent de tous ceux qu'elle avait connus jusqu'alors. Elle qui avait assisté aux efforts de tant de médecins, qui avait vu défiler des prétendants, des amis, des parents, ne tarissait pas d'éloges sur Ludovic. Elle disait qu'il avait une main miraculeuse, qu'il savait parler aux âmes, qu'il était le bienfaiteur de cette maison. Le docteur lui-même, assez sceptique de nature, voyait avec surprise les résultats obtenus par le jeune homme. Il était clair que la présence de Ludovic avait un effet thérapeutique sur la patiente. Leur relation particulière était difficile à définir, mais il était évident que quelque chose de fort les unissait. En quelques jours, la jeune fille se rétablit complètement. Ludovic l'accompagna jusqu'à la porte de sa maison, et quand elle se retourna pour lui dire au revoir, il vit dans ses yeux la reconnaissance, l'amitié, peut-être même plus que ça. Il avait conscience que leur relation était hors-norme, mais il n'arrivait pas à l'analyser. Tout ce qu'il savait, c'était qu'il avait envie de la revoir, qu'il était prêt à tout pour elle.

Ah! oui, je crois que le climat n'est pas sain, vu l'humidité. J'ai peur de prendre racine. Je me sens déjà des fourmis dans les jambes... Al-lons, bonne nuit, caporal. -Dites donc, vous n'êtes pas là pour faire la causette, fit brusquement un adjudant, fermez ça une fois pour toutes. Le mieux pour lui était de ne pas répliquer, car il se sentait dans une atmosphère hostile. Les deux soldats qui partaient, sans plus tarder, mirent leurs sacs, s'éloignèrent sur une poignée de main. -Ce n'est pas confortable là dedans, soupira le Méridional assis en tailleur, j'ai des crampes dans les genoux, mais ce qui me console, c'est que je ne paie pas mon loyer! La nuit s'annonçait assez tranquille, fatigués par les atta-ques des jours précédents, les Allemands paraissaient plutôt inquiets qu'agressifs. Insensible et brisé de fatigue. Buchard s'était endormi. Seul Régnier veillait et comme il n'avait personne à qui parler, il s'était mis à manger un morceau de singe et vidait ce qui lui restait de pinard.","Correct the text: Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul mais une force impérieuse et presque indépen-dante de ma volonté.

À présent, il faut la soutenir moralement autant que physiquement, et c'est vous qui pouvez le mieux le faire. Elle a besoin de votre présence et de votre soutien, et si vous la quittez, elle n'aura plus aucune raison de se battre. Restez avec elle, parlez-lui, encouragez-la, et vous verrez qu'elle se remettra. Ludovic remercia le docteur et suivit son conseil. Il resta auprès de la jeune fille jour et nuit, la soutenant et l'encourageant. Et peu à peu, elle se remit, grâce à la fois au traitement médical et à l'amour et à la présence de Ludovic.
