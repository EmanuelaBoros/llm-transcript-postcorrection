C'étaient des souvenirs laissés à des amies d'enfance ou des dons à de pauvres gens du voisinage qu'elle avait coutume de secourir. Dans l'acte qui instituait le jeune avocat pour son héritier, ces divers voeux étaient exprimés dans la forme la plus simple et la plus touchante. Elle s'excusait d'avoir si peu à offrir, et priait qu'on lui tint compte de l'intention saps s'arrêter à la valeur des choses. Chaque legs était d'ailleurs approprié à la personne avec un soin délicat qui y ajoutait un nouveau prix. Marguerite eut une dernière attention elle laissa son se-crétaire ouvert et plaça sur la tablette la pièce qui rendait Ludovic maître de tout régler chez elle et d'agir à son gré. Près du testament était l'anneau, ce triste et mystérieux em-blème. Dès le premier abord les yeux devaient se porter sur ces objets, et le jeune homme y reconnaîtrait quelles avaient été, au moment de quitter ce monde, la pensée de la mou-rante et sa préoccupation. Quand elle en eut fini avec la terre, Marguerite songea au ciel elle s'agenouilla devant le portrait de sa grand'mère et pria avec ferveur. Que fut cette prière? Sans doute un acte de contritipp et en même temps un cri de désespoir. Elle prit Dieu à témoin, et, lui montrant l'état de son âme, invo-qua sa miséricorde ayec un accent éploré.

Dans l'acte qui instituait le jeune avocat pour son héritier, ces divers voeux étaient exprimés dans la forme la plus simple et la plus touchante. Elle s'excusait d'avoir si peu à offrir, et priait qu'on lui tint compte de l'intention saps s'arrêter à la valeur des choses.

Quand elle en eut fini avec la terre, Marguerite songea au ciel elle s'agenouilla devant le portrait de sa grand'mère et pria avec ferveur. Que fut cette prière? Sans doute un acte de contritipp et en même temps un cri de désespoir. Elle prit Dieu à témoin, et, lui montrant l'état de son âme, invo-qua sa miséricorde ayec un accent éploré. Puis s'adressant à cette aïeule qui avait si saintement vécu et si saintement fini, à sa mère moissonnée avant le temps et qui, son mari mort, avait, elle aussi, manqué de courage, elle les conjura sans doute d'intercéder pour elle et d'obtenir qu'elle fût admise à leurs côtés, daps le séjour des âmes pures ou purifiées par le repentir. Elle leur demanda d'unir leurs prières à la sienne afin d'en augmenter l'effet et d'ob-tenir ce pardon qui descend d'en haut sur les coeurs humi-liés et sincères. Quand elle eut mis sa conscience en paix, autant que le permettait l'acte violent auquel elle était résolue, elle monta sur son lit, ajusta ses vêtements de manière à ce que rien n'y pût amener du désordre, s'étendit sur les coussins, et, s'emparant d'une petite fiole qui était à sa portée, elle l'ap-procha de ses lèvres. 1 Quelques minutes après , elle était plongée dans un en-gourdissement profond.

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solùment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. - Monsieurl s'écria-t-il, Monsieur! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. - Où allez-vous, Monsieur? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait ehez qui ils allaient. - Où je vais? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. - Comment, je le vois? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. - J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. - Votre camarade? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous 1 - Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dtlt-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin.

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solùment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. - Monsieurl s'écria-t-il, Monsieur! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. - Où allez-vous, Monsieur? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait ehez qui ils allaient. - Où je vais? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. - Comment, je le vois? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. - J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. - Votre camarade? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous 1 - Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dtlt-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

278 CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. - Plus vite ce serait difficile nous marchons à en perdre la respiration. - Avez-vous au moins tout ce qu'il vous faut en cas d'é-vénement? - Soyez tranquille - Des antidotes surtout? - Ne vous en préoccupez pas j'y ai songé d'ailleurs c'est de règle aujourd'hui. Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solùment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. - Monsieurl s'écria-t-il, Monsieur! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. - Où allez-vous, Monsieur? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait ehez qui ils allaient. - Où je vais? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. - Comment, je le vois? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. - J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. - Votre camarade? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous 1 - Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dtlt-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

La poursuite continuait. Mais Édouard était rentré dans le jardin. Toute sa famille était là qui l'appelait, qui le cherchait. Son père était sur la plate-forme du perron.
