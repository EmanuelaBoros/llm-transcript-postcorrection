Footnote 134:

  See the first book","In the context of the book, the correction is appropriate","The line, as it stands, is unex- ceptible; we have found the same passage in Pind. Od. 10. 19 ff. The last clause is especially striking. It is a characteristic example of what is often called the λήξις in the poetry of the seventh century. Cf. Ph. 11. 11. 1. 1 (on πορφύγειν, i.e. to run after one another), and l. 8 πέραστοι ... πέρι κτπ. In l. 6 the use of an adverb is characteristic, and in 10. 26 a whole series of examples can be adduced.— This passage is the only instance of any Greek poet (probably the only Greek poet known to us) of using an adverb (πέρειν) to convey the meaning of a passive verb (λάβειν). In other examples (e.g. Ovid., Am. 6. 20) we must regard the passive as the form of a noun: the verb λαβέω is often translated by run after: so we find in Ovid., Met. 4. 1. 26 λαβέω ... νῦν στεῖλον, and in Ovid., Am. 7. 6. 24 τῆς ἐπιγράφεσθαι φθένης, λαβῶ. Aeschylus also seems to use the same form (cp. A. 7. 4 περι ... τήν κρυφήν, in which περι can be construed as running); but he seems to use the form in a more restricted sense.

This error occurs in the eighth",It's a misprint in the Latin text: Zephyrum dicit in plantas,"διοικοσύνην. This is a compound of the same verb as διοικοσύνη, ‘to deceive, or to lie, in a deceitful manner’, Plin. H. M. 1. 40, and is of doubtful construction. It may be a compound of διά (δια) + αὐτόκληρον, ‘that is known to oneself’; or of διά (δια) + οὐκ ἔστιν (οὐκ ἔστι); or of διά (δια) + πρόσθω (προσθω). The last solution is far the most likely, but a construction of this kind is not uncommon in Greek rhetoric.—The idea conveyed by the words διοικοσύνην ‘a deceitful or a false opinion’ is one which belongs to a special class of opinions; and as such it may be taken up and amplified in any degree at will, without any restraint whatever in this respect. Thus in Protag. 1. 23 the deceitful opinion is that the man who is punished is a just man, whereas it is not so; in Herod. 2. 43 that he (Herod) is an innocent man, whereas he is not.—It would seem that ἐπεκπλευ- σόμενον was the original form. The compound πλεύσαμενον would thus be a later development; for the first part is a form common in Greek literature and poetry: it occurs in Plut. Verr. 15, and in Herod. 1. 21; and the second part is not much more common, except in a single instance (see on Procr. 16. 15, πλεύσαμενον γενεὰς ἐκ τῆς ἀπολήχου); but as in both cases it is doubtful, the result is not conclusive. A similar construction is used by Proclus in De interpretatione (in Sect. 13), p. 25, § 2. This would seem to explain how ἐπεκπλευσόμενον might be used in such a sentence as that at the head of this section. But there is no need to look farther for the original sense of the word, for the very existence of the word proves that it had the special meaning",BLOOM-7.1B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,el,results-ajmc_mixed-bigscience-bloom-7b1.jsonl,1049,1.0,0.19607843137254902,-0.803921568627451,99-100%,1.0,0.2,-0.8,99-100%,0.8293103448275863,0.2127659574468085,-0.743442296633786,80-99%,-0.7824546217537457,Negative Improvement

Das Epitheton ξιφοκτόνους vertritt die Stelle von αἵματι (στάζων). 13. ὅτου.. μάθῃς d. i. ſage mir, was du erfahren willſt: ich kann dir Auskunft geben. 14. Bei Sophokles kommt nur die Form Ἀθάνα vor, bei Äſchylos auch die alte, feierliche Form Ἀθηναία. 15. ὡς iſt cauſal. Odyſſeus gibt an, warum er Athena ſofort erkannt habe. εὐμαθές iſt be⸗ tont als Gegenſatz zu ἄποπτος (wenn ich dich auch nicht deutlich ſehe, er⸗ kenne ich doch deutlich deine Stimme""). - ἐάν . . ᾖς, immer wie jetzt.- ἄποπτος („in der Ferne geſehen"") entſpricht der Illuſion, für welche Athena hoch in den Wolken ſchwebt. - ὅμως ſchließt ſich dem Satze mit καὶ εἰ (ἐάν) oder dem entſprechenden Participium an. Kr. II § 56, 13, 2. 16. ξυναρ- πάζω φρενί gibt kräftig die Metapher, die in συνίημι nicht mehr gefühlt wird, und bezeichnet die unmittelbare, raſche Auffaſſung. 17. Die er⸗ ſchütternde und das Herz erbeben machende Stimme der Göttin wird ver⸗ glichen mit der διάτορος Τυρσηνικὴ σάλπιγξ, wie die Drommete, als deren Erfinder die Tyrrhener (Etrusker) galten, Äſch. Eum. 570 wegen ihres ſcharfen, ſchmetternden Tons genannt wird. - ὡς (φώνημα) κώδωνος (κώ- δων das Schalloch der Drommete iſt hier der bezeichnende Teil; die nähere Beſtimmung liegt in Τυρσηνικῆς). Vgl. Hom. Σ 219. 18 f. Mit καὶ νῦν . welches zu ἐπ’ ἀνδρὶ δυσμενεῖ β. κυκλοῦντα gehört, bestätigt Odyſſeus die Übereinſtimmung mit ſeinem ſonſtigen Thun (2). Nach dem Sinne des Odyſſeus ſoll Αἴαντι τ. σ. eine überraſchende Erklärung zu ἀνδρὶ δυσ- μενεῖ ſein. - σακεσφόρος heißt Aias als Träger des σάκος ἑπταβόειον (Hom. H 219 Αἴας δ’ ἐγγύθεν ἦλθε φέρων σάκος ἠύτε πύργον). Vgl. 576.",Correct the text: 576.,".1 s.v. Ἰὔρους, Ἀλεξάνδρους.
Ἰδάμος (grec ancien Ἰδάμον, ἀπόκρι",Correct the text: 573,"19. Aları γενόμενον γενόμενον λέγει er, nach den Erklärungen des P. ποιήμαι. 20. Der Begriff λεγόμενον lässt sich ausschliesslich in den dämonischen Märchen nicht erkennen. 21. Vgl. Aias und τελείων. 22. Πάρσιον επικαλύψαις veröffentlichend im Ἀργείον bei M. P. Celsus. 24. Χαιρήστερον αἰδιότητον εντός τοιούτῳ εἶναι, erklären bei Soph. Met. 769, ὦ κάλλιστον δ’ ἔχουσι δεῖν κατὰ χρόνον ἦν. 25. Aları δοκεῖ μένει (πάριοισι), γενόμενον δὲ δεῖ καὶ δοκεῖ μένει (τύπου), ἣν μὲν διάξαις ἀρχῆ ἀποκατεστήσας διώξας μέγα δοκεῖ μένει (σύλλετον). Die Übereinſtiinung beim δοκεῖ μένει ist bei S. ἀκούσις. 26. Theoretic, wenn al. ποίησε αὐτόν. 27. Vgl. Daf. III 8. 28. A. W. F. C. ii. 972. Die be- tiefste Ältere Stellung erkennt sich bei Sophokles, wo es die Satzklausel nicht, d.h. das Satz εἶναι γενόμενον εἴτε μόνον εἴτε καὶ ἐπιπέμπον βασιλέως αὐτοῦ ἐπιφεύγει καὶ οὐκ ἀνθεόν ἐστιν ἐκείνου ἀποπτεύει. Vgl. also Daf. III 8 972, 1096. 29. Cf. V. W. F. ii. 971. Die Satzklausel des Sophokles, die auf τάξις anwenden, lässt sich auch in den älteren Stellen nicht erkennen, wenn die Satzklausel als Stellung gesetzt werden müssen. Vgl. also Daf. III 8 972, 1096, Hb. Ἑκάρων τάξις. 30. Vgl. al. P. σ. σαφεῖ καὶ διὰ τὸν ἄκρον. — καὶ δεῖ ἀγγέλλειν γενόμενον δὲ ἐξ ἄλσου ἐπισήπη ἀρετήν. Die Übereinſtiinung bei Sophokles war ein Verbleib bei den älteren Stellen. 31. Aları ἄκρων. 32. Aları πόλεμον. — εἰς ἑαυτόν εἰς ἀνδρὸς. 33. Vgl. also Daf. III 8 972, Hb. Ἀποδάκκαλον. 34. Vgl.
