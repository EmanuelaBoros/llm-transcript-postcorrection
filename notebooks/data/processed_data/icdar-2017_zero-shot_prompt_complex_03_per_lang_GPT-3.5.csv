CORRECTED TEXT:","His time he spent in prayer, meditation, and such divine exercises, and did seek by","OF FRYER BACON. 249 My studies have found the secrets of the stars. The books that I have made of them, do serve as presidents to our greatest doctors, so excellent has my judgment been therein. Likewise, I have found out the secrets of trees, plants, and stones, with their several uses. Yet all this knowledge of mine I esteem so lightly, that I wish that I were ignorant and knew nothing. For the knowledge of these things, as I have truly found, does not serve to better a man in goodness, but only to make him proud and think too well of himself. What has all my knowledge of nature's secrets gained me? Only this, the loss of a better knowledge, the loss of divine studies, which make the immortal part of man, his soul, blessed. I have found that my knowledge has been a heavy burden and has kept down my good thoughts. But I will remove the cause, which are these books which I do purpose here before you all to burn. They all entreated him to spare the books, because in them there were those things that future generations might receive great benefit from. He would not hearken unto them but threw them all into the fire, and in that flame burnt the greatest learning in the world. Then he disposed of all his goods, giving some to poor scholars and some to other poor folks. He left nothing for himself, then caused a cell to be made in the church wall, where he locked himself in, and there remained till his death.

When his dame saw that he had so soon ended his business, she thought that he was a profitable servant, and said little but let him alone. In the evening, Rush demanded of his master what he should do the next morrow. His master appointed him twice as much as he did the day before, which Rush did not refuse. He got up early in the morning, and went to the field and began his work as soon as his master was ready. He took his man's breakfast and brought it to the field, thinking to help Rush. But he was no sooner away from his house than the Priest came to see his wife, and she immediately prepared some good food for them to enjoy. While it was cooking, they sat playing together, and those who had been there would have seen many affectionate touches. When the master came to the field, he found that Rush had done everything he had asked. He was greatly amazed. They sat down to breakfast, and as they sat together, Rush noticed his master's shoes. He realized that they were very hard due to lack of grease. Rush said to his master, ""Why aren't your shoes better greased? I wonder how you can walk in them, they are so hard. Don't you have any more at home?"" ""Yes,"" said his master, ""I have another pair lying under a big chest at home in my chamber.""

La feuille à la main, le sergent, debout devant l'abri du colonel, faisait la répartition des postes. - Duruy, dit-il, tu vas monter avec tes hommes au secteur I, tu longeras un peu la route jusqu'aux boyaux B1 et B2, au tournant du ruisseau, ils sont perpendiculaires à la Grande Transversale, après quoi tu monteras tout droit jusqu'au poste du commandant. Ne t'amuse pas en chemin, car à peu près cinq cents mètres avant d'arriver, il voltige des bombes ! Legrand, tu prends le secteur H, dangereux pour les marmites, surtout au Bois de l'Équerre. Tu suivras le boyau central jusqu'au boyau Boscary, où tu trouveras le poste de son com-mandant. Attention vous autres, baissez la tête, les balles tra-versent la route ! Je garde deux hommes avec moi au poste du colonel, à la borne 16. La nuit était venue, pas de lune, une obscurité complète régnait sur les tranchées, et sauf les coups de fusils espacés, partant des premières lignes, la soirée était calme. Les fusées dans le ciel irradiaient par moments l'horizon de leur courbe gracieuse, inondant les parapets d'une lueur blafarde. L'équipe se sépara en deux. Puis, à la file, les nouveaux venus longèrent la route le plus près possible du remblai pour éviter les balles perdues qui froufroutaient avec un bruit de soie, allant frapper les troncs d'arbres de l'autre côté du ruisseau. - Pour une belle nuit, c'est une belle nuit, remarqua Ré-gnier, un combat de nègres sous un tunnel et à chaque fusée il gouaillait Ah ! la belle bleue ! - Allez, activez le mouvement, lança Legrand impatienté, en laissant derrière lui Duruy qui entrait dans son boyau, nous avons encore un bout de chemin !

Il faut si peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux, on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, on puise des motifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul, mais une force impérieuse et presque indépendante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons? La chose en valait-elle la peine? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice, probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif? Voilà à quelles impressions je cédai sans m'en rendre bien compte, ni pénétrer trop avant dans mon cœur. Peut-être, hélas! en interrogeant mieux ce cœur, aurais-je trouvé le dernier mot de ces réticences. La suite ne l'a que trop prouvé, j'étais déjà touchée, j'entrais dans cette série de faiblesses qui m'ont perdu. C'est ici que j'ai besoin de votre pardon, Ludovic, d'un pardon absolu et généreux. Point d'excuse possible, rien qui puisse pallier ce commencement de trahison. Vous aviez été pour moi le meilleur, le plus dévoué et le plus fidèle des amis, vous n'aviez qu'une pensée, mon bonheur, qu'un but, notre union. Jamais, c'est une justice que je me plais à vous rendre, aucun chagrin ne m'est venu de vous. Si j'exprimais un désir, vous vous empressiez de le satisfaire, si j'avais un ennui, vous vous offriez à le partager. Vous étiez de ces loyaux compagnons qu'une femme est trop heureuse de rencontrer dans sa vie, qui l'assistent dans les bons et les mauvais jours et se donnent sans réserve, comme sans calcul. Je voyais tout cela, je le sentais et ne méconnaissais point vos mérites.
