Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu.

C'étaient des souvenirs laissés à des amies d'enfance ou des dons à de pauvres gens du voisinage qu'elle avait coutume de secourir. Dans l'acte qui instituait le jeune avocat pour son héritier, ces divers voeux étaient exprimés dans la forme la plus simple et la plus touchante. Elle s'excusait d'avoir si peu à offrir, et priait qu'on lui tint compte de l'intention saps s'arrêter à la valeur des choses. Chaque legs était d'ailleurs approprié à la personne avec un soin délicat qui y ajoutait un nouveau prix. Marguerite eut une dernière attention elle laissa son se-crétaire ouvert et plaça sur la tablette la pièce qui rendait Ludovic maître de tout régler chez elle et d'agir à son gré. Près du testament était l'anneau, ce triste et mystérieux em-blème. Dès le premier abord les yeux devaient se porter sur ces objets, et le jeune homme y reconnaîtrait quelles avaient été, au moment de quitter ce monde, la pensée de la mou-rante et sa préoccupation. Quand elle en eut fini avec la terre, Marguerite songea au ciel elle s'agenouilla devant le portrait de sa grand'mère et pria avec ferveur. Que fut cette prière? Sans doute un acte de contritipp et en même temps un cri de désespoir. Elle prit Dieu à témoin, et, lui montrant l'état de son âme, invo-qua sa miséricorde ayec un accent éploré.

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solùment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. - Monsieurl s'écria-t-il, Monsieur! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. - Où allez-vous, Monsieur? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait ehez qui ils allaient. - Où je vais? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. - Comment, je le vois? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. - J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. - Votre camarade? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous 1 - Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dtlt-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin.

14 L'ANE GRIS En ce moment, et, comme si elle eût répondu à son appel, la cloche de la maison paternelle retentit dans les airs.

Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu, il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de -cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et ses ennemis vont s'arrêter, bien sûr il n'oseront pas le poursuivre si près de la maison. En tout cas, il y arrivera le premier ! Le petit Edouard se trompait. La poursuite continuait. Mais Édouard était rentré dans le jardin. Toute sa famille était là qui l'appelait, qui le cherchait. Son père était sur la plate-forme du perron. Les domestiques effarés couraient partout avec des lanternes. Chacun criait Édouard, Édouard! La voix de sa soeur venait jusqu'à lui. Papa ! papa ! s'écria Édouard, cher papa ! je suis là ! Et le petit Édouard tombait à moitié mort de peur dans les bras de son père. Mais il n'arrivait pas seul. Les voleurs, les gendarmes, tous ses ennemis, tous ses persécuteurs, animés sans doute, eux aussi, par leur course, avaient franchi la porte du jardin et faisaient effrontément irruption dans le salon en sonnant une fanfare éclatante. Le croirait-on? mais la vérité nous oblige à le confesser la troupe des fantômes devant laquelle avait fui l'intrépide Édouard se composait d'un seul malfaiteur!. son petit âne, qui, en se trouvant tout à coup au milieu des lumières du salon, avait cru devoir célébrer son entrée par le plus beau braiement qui fût jamais sorti de son gosier.
