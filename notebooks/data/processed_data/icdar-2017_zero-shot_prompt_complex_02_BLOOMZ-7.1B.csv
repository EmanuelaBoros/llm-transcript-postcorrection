CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. 269 où cette scène se passait. Par le concours des circonstances, j'étais compromise à un point qu'aucune réparation n'était possible, si ce n'est celle que pouvait m'offrir Melcbior. Son but était atteint il m'avait mise à la discrétion de son hon-neur. Triste garantie ! et je le vis bien plus tard. Je succombai une barrière s'éleva entre vous et moi je ne pouvais plus être à vous, Ludovic. Les heures s'écou-laient il fallut prendre un parti. Encore quelques instants, et vous alliez venir chercher votre fiancée impossible de vous attendre en vous voyant je serais tombée morte à vos pieds. Nous primes donc, Melchior et moi, nos dernières dis-positions. Au petit jour, et quand la porte fut ouverte, il quitta la maison. Un rendez-vous avait été fixé, et je devais aller le rejoindre. Il passa sans être aperçu peut-être le concierge était-il son complice. Quant à moi, je restai pendant une heure encore abîmée dans mes regrets et mes remords. -Toutes vos bontés me revinrent alors à la mémoire, et je me trouvai bien ingrate, bien cruelle et en même temps bien déchue. -Qu'ai liez-vous penser de moi? Hélas 1 quoi que vous pussiez en penser, la réalité dépasserait vos suppositions. J'étais une fille déshonorée ! XXX - Pourtant, Ludovic, je vous écrivis quelques mots, non pas tels que j'aurais voulu les écrire, mais assez précis pour que désormais vous me regardassiez comme perdue pour vous. Puis j'enlevai de mon doigt l'anneau qui me venait de ma grand'mère et qui avait si mal préservé mon honneur. Je n'étais plus digne de le porter, quoi qu'il arrivât et de quel-que façon que tournassent les choses. Je rejoignis Melchior et le trouvai ivre de son bonheur.

On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, -on puise des mo-tifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant- de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua.

Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons? La chose en valait-elle la peine? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, .comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif?

Soudain une tête surgit d'un trou et un bras lui lit signe d'approcher. - C'est nous, fit Régnier, où est le poste? - Y en a pas, répondit une voix, on est tassés dans un gourbi! Couché presque à plat ventre, Régnier se raunJa dans l'exca-vation. - C'est maigre, miladious! murmura-t-il, enQn.! Accroupi, ramassé sur lui-même, 11 établit tant bien que mal sa communication. - Allo! caporal Legrand, c'est vous?. C'est Régnier qui est à l'appareil. Bon. ça marche. Vous dites?. Ah! oui, je crois que le climat n'est pas sain, vu l'humidité. J'ai peur de prendre racine. Je me sens déjà des fourmis dans les jambes. Al-lons, bonne nuit, caporal. - Dites donc, vous n'êtes pas là pour faire la causette, fit brusquement un adjudant, fermez ça une fois pour toutes. Le mieux pour lui était de ne pas répliquer, car il se sentait dans une atmosphère hostile. Les deux soldats qui partaient, sans plus tarder, mirent leuss sacs, s'éloignèrent sur une poignée de main. - Ce n'est pas confortable là dedans, soupira le Méridional assis en tailleur. j'ai des crampes dans tes genoux, mais ce qui me console, c'est que je ne paie pas mon loyer! La nuit s'annonçait assez tranquille, fatigués par les atta. ques des jours précédents, les Allemands paraissaient plutôt inquiets qu'agressifs. Insensible et brisé de fatigue.

Était-ce bien possible, est-ce qu'il ne serait encore que l'heure du coucher?. Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu, il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de -cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et ses ennemis vont s'arrêter, bien sûr il n'oseront pas le poursuivre si près de la maison. En tout cas, il y arrivera le premier ! Le petit Edouard se trompait. La poursuite continuait. Mais Édouard était rentré dans le jardin. Toute sa famille était là qui l'appelait, qui le cherchait. Son père était sur la plate-forme du perron. Les domestiques effarés couraient partout avec des lanternes. Chacun criait Édouard, Édouard! La voix de sa soeur venait jusqu'à lui. Papa ! papa ! s'écria Édouard, cher papa ! je suis là ! Et le petit Édouard tombait à moitié mort de peur dans les bras de son père. Mais il n'arrivait pas seul. Les voleurs, les gendarmes, tous ses ennemis, tous ses persécuteurs, animés sans doute, eux aussi, par leur course, avaient franchi la porte du jardin et faisaient effrontément irruption dans le salon en sonnant une fanfare éclatante.

And when the fray was over and all the noise had ceased, Rush came into the Quier with a lighted candle in his hand, and did as if he had not been at all aware of it, and said to them, ""Fie upon your shame, sirs, how fortunate this discord to end among yourselves; I see well now you do not look to your honour, nor to the good.</s>",BLOOMZ-7.1B,prompt_complex_02,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-bigscience-bloomz-7b1.jsonl,1557,1.0,0.2534562211981567,-0.7465437788018433,99-100%,0.9753164556962025,0.47387830362630606,-0.5141286698704974,80-99%,-0.6303362243361703,Negative Improvement
