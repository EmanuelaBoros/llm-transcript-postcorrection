278 CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. -Plus vite, ce serait difficile nous marchons à en perdre la respiration. -Avez-vous au moins tout ce qu'il vous faut en cas d'é-vénement ? -Soyez tranquille. -Des antidotes surtout ? -Ne vous en préoccupez pas j'y ai songé d'ailleurs c'est de règle aujourd'hui. Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solûment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. -Monsieur! s'écria-t-il, Monsieur ! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. -J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. -Votre camarade ? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous ! -Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dût-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin.

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solûment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. -Monsieur! s'écria-t-il, Monsieur ! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. -J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. -Votre camarade ? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous ! -Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dût-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solùment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. - Monsieurl s'écria-t-il, Monsieur! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. - Où allez-vous, Monsieur? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait ehez qui ils allaient. - Où je vais? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. - Comment, je le vois? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. - J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. - Votre camarade? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous 1 - Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dtlt-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés.

278 CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. -Plus vite, ce serait difficile nous marchons à en perdre la respiration. -Avez-vous au moins tout ce qu'il vous faut en cas d'é-vénement ? -Soyez tranquille. -Des antidotes surtout ? -Ne vous en préoccupez pas j'y ai songé d'ailleurs c'est de règle aujourd'hui. Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solûment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. -Monsieur! s'écria-t-il, Monsieur ! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. -J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. -Votre camarade ? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous ! -Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dût-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication.

Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. -J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. -Votre camarade ? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous ! -Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dût-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

Avant de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul mais une force impérieuse et presque indépen-dante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons ? La chose en valait-elle la peine ? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif ? Voilà à quelles impressions je cédai sans m'en rendre bien compte, ni pénétrer trop avant dans mon coeur Peut-être, hélas ! en interrogeant mieux ce coeur, aurais-je trouvé le dernier mot de ces réticences. La suite ne l'a que trop prouvé j'étais déjà touchée, j'entrais dans cette série de faiblesses qui m'ont perdue. C'est ici que j'ai besoin de votre pardon, Ludovic, d'un pardon absolu et généreux. Point d'excuse possible, rien qui puisse pallier ce commen-cement de trahison. Vous aviez été pour moi le meilleur, le plus dévoué et le plus fidèle des amis vous n'aviez qu'une pensée, mon bonheur qu'un but, notre union. Jamais, c'est une justice que je me plais à vous rendre, aucun chagrin ne m'est venu de vous si j'exprimais un désir, vous vous em-pressiez de le satisfaire si j'avais un ennui, vous vous offriez à le partager. Vous étiez de ces loyaux compagnons qu'une femme est trop heureuse de rencontrer dans sa vie, qui l'as-sistent dans les bons et les mauvais jours et se donnent sans réserve comme sans calcul. Je voyais tout cela, je le sentais et ne méconnaissais point vos mérites. Lui, au contraire, qu'était-il et quel fonds
