Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. -Non, lui dit-il, restez. -Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? -Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Votre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une autre, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. -J'obéis alors. -Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie.

Le docteur comprit le secret de cette volonté que rien ne pouvait vaincre, et, tout en l'écoutant avec une bienveillance parfaite, il eut une grimace, que Marguerite interpréta en ces termes : - Je lui ai dit que je l'aimais. Ah ! il ne m'a pas crue, il ne m'a pas écoutée, il n'a pas voulu entendre ce qu'avait à lui dire mon âme. Tout ceci, le docteur ne pouvait le dire à Ludovic. Il ne s'en trouvait pas digne, car il en sentait la nécessité pour Marguerite, et, en dehors de cela, il était jaloux de cet amour qui venait d'éclater entre ces deux êtres si différents.

Mon père aussi l'avait subi un jour et l'avait trouvé fâcheux; il s'était moqué de sa surprise, de ses larmes, de sa déception et avait dit : « Si nous avions pu être sûrs de sa personne, il n'aurait pas fallu le recevoir en visite et l'avoir au milieu de nous, comme un étranger. Mais son âme a été sauvée et il ne peut donc plus être notre ennemi. » 256
Je croyais avoir été bonne fille en me conduisant ainsi, mais la pensée qu'il m'eût été permis d'être sa femme me tourmentait de plus en plus. Ce serait m'offrir à un démon, car il ne pouvait pas avoir plus d'étourderie et de coquetterie, et je me sentais de plus en plus malheureuse. Et puis ma grand'mère! Il me fallait supporter cet accueil humiliant. Je ne pouvais pas, et je ne voulais pas me séparer d'elle. Je voulais l'aimer sans jamais pouvoir lui plaire. Si nous allions jusqu'à cette épreuve, elle voudrait bien, pour ma honte, me laisser mourir. Je devais donc, de toute ma force, résister, m'empêcher de succomber et de faire le sacrifice de ma vertu. Je voulais me forcer à paraître le moins possible enjouée de la visite de Melchior. Il s'agissait seulement de dissimuler, et de n'être ni laide ni la plus gracieuse, et je me résignais à la voir tous les jours, pendant qu'elle était à la maison, sans essayer de la séduire, et en refusant de m'adresser la parole. Je faisais le tour de la pièce, je m'assurais de la porte, puis je m'endormais, et je m'éveillais la première, dans mon sommeil. Dès le jour qui suivit, je me mis en tête de ne plus aller le voir. Mais je n'avais pas eu le courage d'y renoncer. Dès que ma grand'mère était allée se coucher, je descendais dans le salon, je m'allongeais, et je restais là jusqu'au jour. Je n'avais aucune envie de manger, je ne voulais voir personne, et je ne pouvais me rendre à la messe. Mon seul désir, c'était de rester ici jusqu'à la fin de mes jours, dans ce petit coin de chambre que je trouvais charmant, à l'ombre de mes rideaux et de mes coussins, et où j'avais l'habitude de dormir avec le feu allumé, les pieds sur des livres ou dans le canapé.

Je voulais me forcer à paraître le moins possible enjouée de la visite de Melchior. Il s'agissait seulement de dissimuler, et de n'être ni laide ni la plus gracieuse, et je me résignais à la voir tous les jours, pendant qu'elle était à la maison, sans essayer de la séduire, et en refusant de m'adresser la parole. Je faisais le tour de la pièce, je m'assurais de la porte, puis je m'endormais, et je m'éveillais la première, dans mon sommeil. Dès le jour qui suivit, je me mis en tête de ne plus aller le voir. Mais je n'avais pas eu le courage d'y renoncer. Dès que ma grand'mère était allée se coucher, je descendais dans le salon, je m'allongeais, et je restais là jusqu'au jour. Je n'avais aucune envie de manger, je ne voulais voir personne, et je ne pouvais me rendre à la messe. Mon seul désir, c'était de rester ici jusqu'à la fin de mes jours, dans ce petit coin de chambre que je trouvais charmant, à l'ombre de mes rideaux et de mes coussins, et où j'avais l'habitude de dormir avec le feu allumé, les pieds sur des livres ou dans le canapé.

C'étaient des souvenirs laissés à des amies d'enfance ou des dons à de pauvres gens du voisinage qu'elle avait coutume de secourir. Dans l'acte qui instituait le jeune avocat pour son héritier, ces divers voeux étaient exprimés dans la forme la plus simple et la plus touchante. Elle s'excusait d'avoir si peu à offrir, et priait qu'on lui tint compte de l'intention saps s'arrêter à la valeur des choses. Chaque legs était d'ailleurs approprié à la personne avec un soin délicat qui y ajoutait un nouveau prix. Marguerite eut une dernière attention elle laissa son se-crétaire ouvert et plaça sur la tablette la pièce qui rendait Ludovic maître de tout régler chez elle et d'agir à son gré. Près du testament était l'anneau, ce triste et mystérieux em-blème. Dès le premier abord les yeux devaient se porter sur ces objets, et le jeune homme y reconnaîtrait quelles avaient été, au moment de quitter ce monde, la pensée de la mou-rante et sa préoccupation. Quand elle en eut fini avec la terre, Marguerite songea au ciel elle s'agenouilla devant le portrait de sa grand'mère et pria avec ferveur. Que fut cette prière? Sans doute un acte de contritipp et en même temps un cri de désespoir. Elle prit Dieu à témoin, et, lui montrant l'état de son âme, invo-qua sa miséricorde ayec un accent éploré.

Me priver de vous en les avouant ou les cacher en les dissimulant ? Vous savez qu'il faut tout dire et qu'il n'y a rien à dissimuler. Je ne le puis, je ne le veux pas. Si je devais lui avouer que je l'aime, il me refuserait son amour, il m'abandonnerait. Cela ne lui est pas possible. Mais je le sais et il est possible qu'il ignore tout.

Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif ? Voilà à quelles impressions je cédai sans m'en rendre bien compte, ni pénétrer trop avant dans mon coeur Peut-être, hélas ! en interrogeant mieux ce coeur, aurais-je trouvé le dernier mot de ces réticences. La suite ne l'a que trop prouvé j'étais déjà touchée, j'entrais dans cette série de faiblesses qui m'ont perdue. C'est ici que j'ai besoin de votre pardon, Ludovic, d'un pardon absolu et généreux. Point d'excuse possible, rien qui puisse pallier ce commen-cement de trahison. Vous aviez été pour moi le meilleur, le plus dévoué et le plus fidèle des amis vous n'aviez qu'une pensée, mon bonheur qu'un but, notre union. Jamais, c'est une justice que je me plais à vous rendre, aucun chagrin ne m'est venu de vous si j'exprimais un désir, vous vous em-pressiez de le satisfaire si j'avais un ennui, vous vous offriez à le partager. Vous étiez de ces loyaux compagnons qu'une femme est trop heureuse de rencontrer dans sa vie, qui l'as-sistent dans les bons et les mauvais jours et se donnent sans réserve comme sans calcul. Je voyais tout cela, je le sentais et ne méconnaissais point vos mérites.

Il ne,"ntrevoir dans son coeur, dans sa pensée ? Je ne pouvais rien me figurer, tout m'est demeuré inexpliqué. Avez-vous remarqué que, quand on ne connaît rien à autrui, lorsqu'on ignore ce qui se passe dans son coeur et dans sa cervelle, on se trompe toujours ? En me fiant à mon instinct je me trompais. Vous, qui m'aimiez, qui vouliez seulement me bien, je croyais que vous aviez la même pensée que moi, j'imaginais qu'on partageait les mêmes idées, qu'on avait la même affection pour moi. Il me semble pourtant que je le devinai si bien et qu'il eut cette même pensée qu'il en devint jaloux. 258 Vous vous trompez, Ludovic, en jugeant de la passion que j'éprouvais pour lui. Peut-être vous le deviniez sans savoir le dire et vous en aviez la preuve. Il fallait que ce fût là son secret. Vous êtes bien sûr, c'est tout ce que vous avez à dire et vous n'avez pas voulu me demander si je l'aimais ? Mais il y a une question qu'il ne faut pas poser, c'est la dernière, je l'ai dit, c'est celle qui nous arracherait à tout notre bonheur. Vous savez, Ludovic, que j'aime et que j'aime avec passion. Je le crois, je vous l'ai dit, je l'aime et ne vois pas en lui l'homme que j'aime. Je me flatte, je me le déclare, je m'y efforce, mais je n'y arrive pas. Je le vois, je le sens, je le connais, mais je ne le crois pas. Il est impossible que je le croie et cela ne m'est pas possible, je crois, je veux croire, mais je n'y parviens pas. Je le vois, je le sens, je le connais. C'est ce que j'avais dit à cette femme. Tout est dit, je ne le verrai jamais. Il ne sera jamais pour moi ce qu'il est pour vous et vous ne serez jamais pour lui ce que vous êtes pour moi. Que faire donc ? Que faire de ces sentiments ? Me priver de vous en les avouant ou les cacher en les dissimulant ? Vous savez qu'il faut tout dire et qu'il n'y a rien à dissimuler. Je ne le puis, je ne le veux pas. Si je devais lui avouer que je l'aime, il me refuserait son amour, il m'abandonnerait. Cela ne lui est pas possible. Mais je le sais et il est possible qu'il ignore tout. Il peut, ce me semble, n'avoir jamais douté que je ne l'aimât et s'il l'a su et le sent maintenant, ce ne peut être qu'à votre insu. Mais alors, que faire ? Que lui dire ?

Je croyais m'amuser à me distraire. Elle, à faire les yeux doux à un inconnu qui lui avait été présenté,","Le soleil commençait à se lever. Comme il l'avait fait pour le premier jour, 11 tira de son sac un peu d'argenterie - un couteau et une boîte d'allumettes - qu'il enfila, tout en se rengorgeant d'une satisfaction malsaine, comme il l'avait fait pour la première fois, la veille de cette sortie. - C'est ça, je vais être content de la prendre cette guerre! pensa-t-il. Et il regarda un instant autour de lui. La tranchée était à peu près rectangulaire et ne faisait guère plus de deux mètres sur trois. Son sol était en terre battue et les hommes étaient en bon état, comme la plupart des tranchées à cette époque. Mais il se sentait mal à l'aise. Une impression de vide, de néant l'envahissait, la monotonie des bruits qu'il entendait, les pas des soldats qui avançaient sans lui, le son du canon, le vent du matin qui sifflait, le bruissement de l'herbe mouillée, cette odeur de boue qui lui collait à la peau, tout cela contribuait à la déprime. Mais il ne pouvait pas se forcer, il n'avait pas envie de parler, pas envie de bouger, surtout pas envie de se lever. Il allait sans doute rester couché jusqu'au petit jour. Au moins, ainsi il n'aurait pas à se mêler à ces gens qui l'entouraient, et qui ne faisaient qu'étouffer les bruits qui lui venaient des entrailles. Il pensait aux petites filles qu'il avait vues pleurer dans la rue. 11 se sentit très loin de ces hommes, dans un autre temps, à une époque heureuse. A la guerre, il n'avait pas connu ça. Il se trouvait si loin de tout. Il ne pensait qu'à retourner se coucher, même si cela signifiait pour lui devoir rester une nuit de plus dans ce coin de tranchée. Il avait des idées bizarres, il sentait une faim étrange, il ne voulait pas manger, et il ne mangea pas. Il se sentait très mal, et il s'abandonna à cette idée que la terre avait des yeux et qu'il entendait tout ce que ces hommes disaient. Il rêvait d'un moment, à une époque heureuse, où les hommes vivaient heureux et heureux ils ne mouraient pas. Puis tout à coup, 11 se rappela que la mort n'avait pas de secret pour lui.
