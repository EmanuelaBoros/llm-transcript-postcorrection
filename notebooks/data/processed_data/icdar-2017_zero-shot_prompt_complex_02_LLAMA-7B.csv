THE MYSTERY HAD ALREADY STARTED. HE AND I WERE NOW DEVELOPING A KIND OF UNCERTAINTY TOGETHER, WE ARE BEGINNING TO WORK IT ALL OUT. I WAS SO FURIOUS AT HIS LETTING HIMSELF BE SEEN AND ATTRACTING SUCH ATTENTION, I VOWED I WOULD DO EVERYTHING I COULD TO AVOID BEING SEEN AGAIN AND I SWEAR TO YOU I WILL NOT GET INTO SUCH A SITUATION AGAIN.

Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait où ils allaient. - Où je vais? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. - Comment, je le vois? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire ni me fournir un mot d'explication.

Comment: It's because you've put the wrong line breaks between the `enumerate` counter labels. See `enumitem` package's section `5.2.2`. I.e., you need a space at the end of the first line.

Comment: @egreg: I have added the missing space between the `enumitem` package's section `5.2.2` and the code. And the line breaks were fine. The line breaks were OK, but the lines were just too long and got cut off by the length limit here.

To execute the same, bee hyred a Walloon souldier, and gave him one hundred crownes to do the same, fifty beforehand, and fifty when hee had kdled him. Fryer Bacon, to save himselfe from this danger that was like to happen to him would alwayes wrhen that he read, hold a ball of brasse in his hand, and under that ball would hee set a bason of brasse, that if hee did chance to sleepe in bis reading, the fall of the ball out of his hand into the bason, might wake him. Being one day in his study in this manner, and asleepe, the Walloon souldier was got in to him, and had drawne his sword to kiU him but as hee was ready for to strike, downe fell the ball out of Fryer Bacon's hand, and waked him. Hee seeing the souldier stand there with a sworddrawne, asked him what hee was ? and wherefore hee came there in that manner ?

Comment: Is it possible to avoid using `minipage` (in your first MWE, this doesn't help, you can simply add `\\` between your lines). `minipage` is a bit awkward, if the text on the first line is too wide, it won't be centered.

Comment: Is it possible to avoid using `minipage` (in your first MWE, this doesn't help, you can simply add `\\` between your lines). `minipage` is a bit awkward, if the text on the first line is too wide, it won't be centered.

Answer: You could add the `center` environment. For example:

Soudain une tête surgit d'un trou et un bras lui lit signe d'approcher.

- Y en a pas, répondit une voix, on est tassés dans un gourbi!

Comment: Is it possible to avoid using `minipage` (in your first MWE, this doesn't help, you can simply add `\\` between your lines). `minipage` is a bit awkward, if the text on the first line is too wide, it won't be centered.

Answer: You could add the `center` environment. For example:

Comment: Is it possible to avoid using `minipage` (in your first MWE, this doesn't help, you can simply add `\\` between your lines). `minipage` is a bit awkward, if the text on the first line is too wide, it won't be centered.

Answer: You could add the `center` environment. For example:

Comment: Is it possible to avoid using `minipage` (in your first MWE, this doesn't help, you can simply add `\\` between your lines). `minipage` is a bit awkward, if the text on the first line is too wide, it won't be centered.

Answer: You could add the `center` environment. For example:

Comment: Is it possible to avoid using `minipage` (in your first MWE, this doesn't help, you can simply add `\\` between your lines). `minipage` is a bit awkward, if the text on the first line is too wide, it won't be centered.

Answer: You could add the `center` environment. For example:

Comment: Is it possible to avoid using `minipage` (in your first MWE, this doesn't help, you can simply add `\\` between your lines). `minipage` is a bit awkward, if the text on the first line is too wide, it won't be centered.

Était-ce bien possible, est-ce qu'il ne serait encore que l'heure du coucher?. Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu, il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de -cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et ses ennemis vont s'arrêter, bien sûr il n'oseront pas le poursuivre si près de la maison. En tout cas, il y arrivera le premier ! Le petit Edouard se trompait. La poursuite continuait. Mais Édouard était rentré dans le jardin. Toute sa famille était là qui l'appelait, qui le cherchait. Son père était sur la plate-forme du perron. Les domestiques effarés couraient partout avec des lanternes. Chacun criait Édouard, Édouard! La voix de sa soeur venait jusqu'à lui. Papa ! papa ! s'écria Édouard, cher papa ! je suis là !

Encore un effort et ses ennemis vont s'arrêter, bien sûr il n'oseront pas le poursuivre si près de la maison. En tout cas, il y arrivera le premier ! Le petit Edouard se trompait. La poursuite continuait. Mais Édouard était rentré dans le jardin. Toute sa famille était là qui l'appelait, qui le cherchait. Son père était sur la plate-forme du perron. Les domestiques effarés couraient partout avec des lanternes. Chacun criait Édouard, Édouard!

Papa ! papa ! s'écria Édouard, cher papa ! je suis là ! Et le petit Édouard tombait à moitié mort de peur dans les bras de son père. Mais il n'arrivait pas seul. Les voleurs, les gendarmes, tous ses ennemis, tous ses persécuteurs, animés sans doute, eux aussi, par leur course, avaient franchi la porte du jardin et faisaient affrontée irruption dans le salon en sonnant une fanfare éclatante.

There are two tags, one is the one that you want to copy and paste to the text area. The other is one that is blank, which you can simply leave blank.

You do not have to worry about the spelling mistakes, as you can fix them in the text area.

This will work for all the OCR texts on the website.

Comment: thanks for the answer, but how to tell the program to do this for each different text box?

Comment","14 L'ANE GRIS

Était-ce bien possible, est-ce qu'il ne serait encore que l'heure du coucher?. Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu, il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner.

Encore un effort et ses ennemis vont s'arrêter, bien sûr il n'oseront pas le poursuivre si près de la maison. En tout cas, il y arrivera le premier ! Le petit Edouard se trompait. La poursuite continuait. Mais Édouard était rentré dans le jardin. Toute sa famille était là qui l'appelait, qui le cherchait. Son père était sur la plate-forme du perron. Les domestiques effarés couraient partout avec des lanternes. Chacun criait Édouard, Édouard!

Papa ! papa ! s'écria Édouard, cher papa ! je suis là ! Et le petit Édouard tombait à moitié mort de peur dans les bras de son père. Mais il n'arrivait pas seul. Les voleurs, les gendarmes, tous ses ennemis, tous ses persécuteurs, animés sans doute, eux aussi, par leur course, avaient franchi la porte du jardin et faisaient affrontée irruption dans le salon en sonnant une fanfare éclatante. Le croirait-on? mais la vérité nous oblige à le confesser la troupe des fantômes devant laquelle avait fui l'intrépide Édouard se composait d'un seul malfaiteur!. son petit âne, qui, en se trouvant tout à coup au milieu des lumières du salon, avait cru devoir célébrer son entrée par le plus beau braiement qui fût jamais sorti de son gosier.

Comment: You should have two `replace()` functions in `replace_text()` function. one for `replace(regex, regex_group)` and other for `replace(string, string_group)`
