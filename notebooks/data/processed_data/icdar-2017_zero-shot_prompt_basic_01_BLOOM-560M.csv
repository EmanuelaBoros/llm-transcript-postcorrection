J'ai été très-affectée et je me sentais comme une enfant devant un père aimant. Le silence était très-tôt troublé, et, au fur et à mesure que les voix me parlaient, mon coeur s'est mis en émoi. En pleurant je me suis allongée sur le rebord du lit, et, sans pouvoir le réveiller, je me suis hâté d'aller au-dehors, jusqu'à ce que le bruit d'un fracas retentit et que j'entendis à la porte se saisir la fille. Je me rendis aussitôt au bout de la pièce, en laissant un passage étroit à la fille. Mes pensées étaient en train de se dé-livrer et je me sentais seule avec mon ami, je ne m'étais pas sentie seule avant. Mais il fut trop tard, il ne me quitta plus.

Mais le lendemain matin, quand j'ai vu Ludovic et Melchior ensemble, je me suis sentie bien mieux. J'étais comme une vieille femme qui s'est débarrassée de ses dettes, et qui a appris à faire le deuil de sa vie. Je n'étais pas encore entrée dans les entrailles de mon corps, mais Melchior était là. Il se tenait là près de moi, avec la main sur la bouche et il ne savait même pas qu'il s'agissait de moi. Quand Melchior a senti le contact entre mon corps et celui de Ludovic, il m'a regardé avec ce regard que la vie m'avait enseigné à ne pas écouter et à ne pas regarder. Je lui ai appris que j'ignorais à peine ce qui se passait en moi. A son tour, le lendemain matin, il m'a regardé et il a dit: « Tu t'es trompée de fiancée, tu es comme une vieille femme qui s'est débarrassée de ses dettes, et qui a appris à faire le deuil de sa vie. » « Et tu l'as tuée, moi ! tu l'as tuée. » C'était le sentiment de moi qui lui avait tant manqué en moi et en mes amis. J'étais une femme très vieille, tellement vieille que Ludovic avait réussi à la prendre sous ses ailes. Ludovic était un ami. Je n'avais pas envie de perdre de ce temps précieux que nous avions pris ensemble, de ce temps qu'on a partagé.

Je me suis sentie mieux que jamais. J'ai enfin compris que j'étais une fille libre et indépendante. Le temps s'est arrêté. Il ne restait plus rien pour moi, je savais que Ludovic s'était trompé.

M. Jean-Noël Gingras, président de l’","mon amour, tu es la seule qui n'ait jamais osé embrasser une femme de son âge, la seule dont je n'eusse jamais voulu la rejoindre. Mais le lendemain matin, quand j'ai vu Ludovic et Melchior ensemble, je me suis sentie bien mieux. J'étais comme une vieille femme qui s'est débarrassée de ses dettes, et qui a appris à faire le deuil de sa vie. Je n'étais pas encore entrée dans les entrailles de mon corps, mais Melchior était là. Il se tenait là près de moi, avec la main sur la bouche et il ne savait même pas qu'il s'agissait de moi. Quand Melchior a senti le contact entre mon corps et celui de Ludovic, il m'a regardé avec ce regard que la vie m'avait enseigné à ne pas écouter et à ne pas regarder. Je lui ai appris que j'ignorais à peine ce qui se passait en moi. A son tour, le lendemain matin, il m'a regardé et il a dit: « Tu t'es trompée de fiancée, tu es comme une vieille femme qui s'est débarrassée de ses dettes, et qui a appris à faire le deuil de sa vie. » « Et tu l'as tuée, moi ! tu l'as tuée. » C'était le sentiment de moi qui lui avait tant manqué en moi et en mes amis. J'étais une femme très vieille, tellement vieille que Ludovic avait réussi à la prendre sous ses ailes. Ludovic était un ami. Je n'avais pas envie de perdre de ce temps précieux que nous avions pris ensemble, de ce temps qu'on a partagé. Quand je suis revenue en vie, je n'avais plus que les yeux pour voir ce que Ludovic regardait à moi, mais je n'avais plus que la tête pour pouvoir croire ce que Ludovic disait à moi.

Une femme du monde a une idée précise de Dieu,","'engager pour lui ? La femme, si elle en veut à quelqu'un qui en avait rien à voir, n'attend pas qu'on lui donne de l'amour, qu'elle veut une vie digne d'elle. Et en ce moment même, je sentais la fièvre monter en moi. L'amour que vous lui étiez né- vait se dissiper, il ne tenait pas debout et je venais à peine d'achever le chapitre de cette histoire que je me disais que j'avais laissé à ma femme ce qui lui appartenait, qui lui était redevable et qu'il ne devait en rien s'en mêler. Je ne voyais pas en ce que j'éprouvais quelque intérêt particulier à vous mais le souvenir de vos premiers pas me rappela quelque chose qui me quittait, ce que je n'avais pas encore vu, ce qu'il en restait, ce que je n'avais pas voulu perdre, ce qu'il me serait arrivé par amour, à ma manière, si cela était possible et en moi. Vous vous étiez, vous le vouliez ou non, reconnu comme tel. Pour vous, je ne savais pas de quoi vous parliez. Mon imagination et ma mémoire étaient encore un peu plus douées que ma propre âme, il me semblait que je ne les aurais jamais retrouvées, que j'étais déjà le bienvenu de cette maison. Votre femme ne l'ignorait pas et vous étiez en effet le bienvenu dans ma vie. Mais je crois que cela ne vous surprendra pas, Ludovic. Elle était plus belle, plus mûre, plus belle que moi, et je me disais que je ne devais pas m'attendre à une seconde et même si, je sais, il y avait une certaine erreur, à laquelle je n'ai pas eu le plaisir de m'abstenir, je ne croyais pas qu'on puisse être une femme au goût du beau et au coeur tendre à la manière d'un vrai amant. Alors vous m'avez dit ce que je croyais être vrai et que j'attendais d'une femme que j'adore. Cela est vrai, bien que ce soit la vérité, ce n'est pas l'amour dont je rêvais. Vous ne me connaissiez pas, non, vous m'aviez rendu service, non. Vous aviez de la chance de vivre encore et d'être si heureuse, pour moi, de vous avoir à mon coeur, en tout cas, de vous avoir fait ma préférée. Et en retour, elle vous avait laissé les épaules libres. Je suis sûr que vous avez dû ressentir un grand amour pour moi.

They having given the Devill this bloud, as is before spoken of, they both fell againe to their coniurations first, Bungye did rayse Achilles with his Greekes, who marched about Vandermast and threatned him. Then Vandermast raised Hector with his Troians, who defended him from Achilles and the Greekes. Then began there a great battell between the Greekes and Troians, which continued a good space at last Hector was slaine, and the Troians fled.

He then did tell the two Coniecers, that he would make them both go away and bring them back together to the Hke and the Devill. They both thought their thoughts, that they were now to come together to fight for the throne. And as they knew that they had been so good to the Hke, they said, that if we both should come and fight for the throne, if the Hke would grant us that then he would be our Hke; and if he would not, then he would not be. If a man shall say to me that if I do not grant him that, then I will not grant him another one, the one that comes from me will go away from my hand and no longer come. That is why they say, that the time is come when they will fight for the throne, for the Hke will grant them that. So then the Hke told them, that if they both were to fight, if their Hke would grant them both and would not grant them both, the two will then become friends and fight each other till their death. But as to the Hke himself, he did not believe they would ever fight with him againe. But did they ever be able to hear the harking of a thunder of lightning, as it sounded to them, which came in great thunder, and that a man could not hear it? Or the sound of the thunder, that as it sounded to the Hke, it was like a flame of fire, that he could not catch fire for but half a snail's length. So then the Hke did tell them of this, that they should not fight the more than they could do.

And when the great prince of devils which are the patrones of all vices understood of the great misrule and vile living of these religious men consulted to keepe them still in that state, and worse if it might be. And these be the names of the devils. Belphegor who was Prince of Gluttony, Asmodeus Prince of Lechery, and Belzebub Prince of Envie, with many other divels assembled together, which reioyced for the misorder of these religious men. And as they were all assembled together with one accord they chose a divell to goe and dwell among these religious men, for to maintaine them the longer in their ungracious living, which divell was put in rayment like an earthly crea-ture, and went to a religious house, and there he stood at the gate a certaine space all alone with an heavie countenance. Then within a while after the Priour came unto the gate and espied Rush the young man standing there all alone. Anon he said unto him, what dost thou here, and what wouldest thou have. The young man with great reverence answered and said Sir, I am a poore young man, and am out of service, and faine would have a maister.

The child hath been my servant for some years, he has kept me, for he hath kept the child from his father, and hath kept me safe till I was grown to be old. And it is therefore that I will speak unto you, that if any one ask me to go unto the gate of the church, which is in the main land, the same shall doe so as to be in my service and in that of his brethren, and to come into their presence, and to keep my secret, and if he ask him, will I tell him of my son. But he that doe not take it upon himself to know my name, and say, I am the same that the little child that I have by your hand. This is the word of the Lord to me. Now therefore the young man said, Sir, if I might find you a father to this son, will you leave me and staye and serve with him and his brethren till they are old, and then I will give him a place in the church, to keep the secret and doe honour to him. The Priour, being therefore very astonished with his knowledge, went on unto the gate of the church.
