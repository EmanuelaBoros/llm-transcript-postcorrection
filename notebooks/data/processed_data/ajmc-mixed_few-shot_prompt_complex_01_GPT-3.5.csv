If τοι is retained in infr. 245, we may read here οἵαν ἐδήλωσας *κατ’ ἀνδρὸς αἴθονος. The short syllable in αἴθονος is sufficiently supported by αἴθονα occur- ring in Hesychius in the right alpha- betical order (immediately after αἶθον). Although αἴθοπος (see v. rr.) may be defended, on the ground that the second part of a compound has sometimes little significance (see esp. infr. 954, κελαι- νώπαν θυμόν), yet αἴθων, which directly expresses character, is more appropriate here, and has the preponderance of MS. authority in its favour. 222. ἄτλατον οὐδὲ φευκτάν] ‘That can neither be avoided nor endured.’ 225. μεγάλων] ‘Terrible.’ The mari- ners, in their feebleness (supr. 165 foll.), are afraid of the opinion of the host. These words are added as a comment on οὐδὲ φευκτάν. The consequences of the fact cannot be eluded, since it is known to the host, and magnified by rumour. 226. ὁ μέγας μῦθος] ‘The formidable power of rumour.’ Supr. 172, ὦ μεγάλα φάτις. μῦθος is the rumour about this particular thing, with a suggestion of rumour in general. ἀέξει] Not ‘exaggerates,’ for the evil could not be exaggerated, but, ‘which the mighty power of rumour spreads abroad.’",No text,226. ὁ μέγας μῦθος] 'The formidable',There is no error in this text.,"539).

The word ἀτάλλω (which in Il. 13. 27 means 'to gambol') bears the sense of 'cherishingʼ in Hom. epigr. 4. 2 νήπιον αἰδοίης ἐπὶ γούνασι μητρὸς ἀτάλλων, and Pind. fr. 214 γλυκεῖά οἱ καρδίαν ἀτάλλοισα.. ἐλπίς.
