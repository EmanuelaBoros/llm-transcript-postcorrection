Pliny, in Natural History 18.34, says that Zephyr exercises a nourishing effect on plants. Lucian, in Bis accus. § 1, calls them ""pure breezes."" Catullus 62.39 describes a flower that is nurtured by the wind, strengthened by the sun, and brought to maturity by the rain. The phrase ""cherishing soul"" (ψυχὴν ἀτάλλων) may be compared to Sophocles' Trachiniae 144, where the growth of a young animal is nurtured in such places. The word ἀτάλλω used to mean ""gambol"" in Homer's Iliad, but it carries the sense of ""cherishing"" in Homeric epigrams and in Pindar's fragment 214. In Homer's Odyssey 18.323, the form ἀτιτάλλω is used to describe how a parent nurtures a child. Perhaps this phrase was inspired by the scene between Hector and Andromache in Iliad 6.400, where Hector clearly cherishes his son.",GPT-3.5,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,el,results-ajmc_mixed-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl,1049,0.9459459459459459,0.7083333333333334,-0.25119047619047613,80-99%,0.8888888888888888,0.043478260869565216,-0.9510869565217391,80-99%,0.8293103448275863,0.20305052430886558,-0.7551573719352557,80-99%,-0.6524782682158237,Negative Improvement

666. Schol. (Scholiast) sarcastically twisted the phrase, using irony; he should have said that we should worship the gods and yield to the Atreides, as in line 668. The use of the plural ""we will go"" and ""we will place"" is also ironic, as it refers to both Atreides being rulers/power holders instead of just Agamemnon. Menelaos unlawfully wants to be equal to his brother, as seen in line 812. 
668. Ajax ironically brings up Solon's proverbial advice ""Listen to the rulers and be just, whether it be good or evil,"" as seen in line Ant. 63. 
666 or ""The city will prosper when it hears and follows both the small, just things and the opposite of those."" 
669 and following lines show that Ajax believes that it is necessary to flatter and deceive the Atreides since they hold the title of rulers and conquerors, as everything wild belongs to the bright and beautiful, whereas everything violent and fearful belongs to the bold and commanding.",GPT-3.5,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,el,results-ajmc_mixed-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl,919,0.8235294117647058,0.2777777777777778,-0.6626984126984127,80-99%,1.0,0.0,-1.0,99-100%,0.9325481798715204,0.212461695607763,-0.7721708109097007,80-99%,-0.8116230745360378,Negative Improvement
