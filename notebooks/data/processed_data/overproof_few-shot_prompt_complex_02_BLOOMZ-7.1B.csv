With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning.

The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the ranges left more than two hours later.

As the door was opened, his confederates pushed their way- in with drawn revolvers. The watchmen were threatened with death If they made any outcry or attempt to escape and one shot was fired by way of warning.

Travelling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, twenty armed bandits early today swooped down on the Old Horpey Distillery, near Frederick, Md., and made off with $84,000 worth of choice old whiskey, leaving three Government watchmen bound and gagged, under threat of instant death if they attempted to raise an alarm. % Beyond the fact that an abandoned truck, laden with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey, was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore pike, there is no clue to the direction taken by the caravan.

With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning. While the motorcycle men scattered to guard every approach to the building, fifteen of the bandits broke into the office and overpowered the three watchmen-John R. Hemp, of Burkettaville, Md.: William Hart, of Baltimore, and John Moredock. of Baltimore. The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the ranges left more than two hours later. From fifty to sixty barrels of the aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons In all, was rolled from the building and leaded on the trucks and touring cars.

The watch men were admonished against any attempt to escape and the caravan made off. Telephone Lines Cut. Hemp finally broke loose.

As the door was opened, his confederates pushed their way- in with drawn revolvers. The watchmen were threatened with death If they made any outcry or attempt to escape and one shot was fired by way of warning.

The distillery is thought to have been under close surveillance, day and night, by bandit spies, who learned every movement of the watchmen. Seven Autos In Raid. With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning. While the motorcycle men scattered to guard every approach to the building, fifteen of the bandits broke into the office and overpowered the three watchmen-John R. Hemp, of Burkettaville, Md.: William Hart, of Baltimore, and John Moredock. of Baltimore. The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the ranges left more than two hours later. From fifty to sixty barrels of the aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons In all, was rolled from the building and leaded on the trucks and touring cars. It took the bandits until nearly 4: o'clock to complete the loading of the caravan Then the motorcycle outposts reported the roads clear. The watch men were admonished against any attempt to escape and the caravan made off. Telephone Lines Cut. Hemp finally broke loose. He found the telephone lines had been cut and was forced to walk, a long distance before he could spread the alarm. Sheriff James C. Jones was notified and telephoned the police at all nearby points to watch dvery road away from Frederick In spite of the network, the bandits managed to slip through, and no clue no to the direction they took has been discovered, except for the abandoned truck at Jefferson. it is the belief of Sheriff Jones that the bandits were the same men who robbed the distillery of 200 cases of whiskey December 9 la*.

The watchmen told Sheriff Jones that at 2 o'clock a man who represented himself as an internal revenue agent from Washington appeared at the door of the office and demanded admittance. As the door was opened, his confederates pushed their way- in with drawn revolvers. The watchmen were threatened with death If they made any outcry or attempt to escape and one shot was fired by way of warning. Then the watchmen were backed against the wall, disarmed, and tied hand and foot with heavy cords.
