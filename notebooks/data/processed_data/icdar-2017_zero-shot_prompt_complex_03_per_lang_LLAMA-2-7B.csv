Oui, l'anneau était le symbole de tout ce que représentait le père de ce fils.

Il était aussi le symbole de tout ce qu'était le fils, le fils qui avait pris en saî-gne le père, qui avait été plus que fils, qui avait été tout.

La maison de l'officier est à cinq minutes d'ici.

Il fait obscur.

Un enfant a les yeux rouges.

La police ne peut pas agir. Il y a des pistolets à la main.

La police est trop faible. On lui donne des balles. On lui dit d'attaquer.

","MONSIEUR ET MADAME GALLOCHARD, Vaud.

Votre maison, M. et Mme Gallochard, Vaud, me semble être une de celles dont je pouvais plus volontiers rêver qu'apercevoir; je la trouve si propre, si convenable, si entourée de si belles et si propres terres, que je croyais qu'il fallait que vous y aimassiez beaucoup pour y résider; mais en apercevant votre maison, et la réception que je me suis faite de votre famille, je vois que ce n'est point là une fantaisie, mais le produit d'un bon goût et d'une grande prudence. Votre maison est bien placée","La Marquise de Sennertaille, comédie en 1 acte, par MM. Paul Siraudin et P. Marcellus.

","LA MARQUISE DE PRÉTINTAILLE, vaud.

La marquise de Préventaille est une des plus belles femmes de Provence et de la cour de Versailles. Elle est la tante de madame de Montesson, et ma mère, marquise de Vaulnais, était une très bonne amie de la marquise de Préventaille. Ce fut ma mère qui m'apprit les secrets de ma beauté. J'avais six ans quand ma mère m'emmena chez ma tante. Je n'ai jamais oublié le premier regard que me fit ma tante. Elle me dit: 

Ma fille chère, vous êtes un parfait modèle. Votre peau est si blanche","La Marquise de Sennertaille, comédie en 1 acte, par MM. Paul Siraudin et P. Marcellus.

Maison d'Angleterre.

Entre la Reine, CÉCILE, & autres dames.

Reine.

Amiable reine de France, j'ai envoyé, comme à telle condition que je devois vous remercier de mon humble service: l'hommage de ma cour et mon propre contentement de vous avoir vue, à votre royale personne.

CÉCILE.

Je suis bien aise que le souvenir de cette visite, à la reine d'Angleterre, m'a plu. Je ne puis sans en souvenir, m'étonner de ce que j'y ai vu","La Marquise de Sennertaille, comédie en 1 acte, par MM. Paul Siraudin et P. Marcellus.

","L'ouvrier

1re scène

[Il est minuit.

La scène se passe dans un petit cabinet d'atelier de la fabrique
à machines; deux fenêtres qui donnent sur la cour de l'usine.

Les pots de fleurs qui sont dans le cabinet sont allumés; un petit
établissement de chaise et de table, avec une couverture; un lit
(à la turque) qui s'allonge tout contre la porte; des vêtements
également de nuit se trouvent sur le lit; un chapeau rouge, un pardessus, un manteau, et des souliers. L'ONTARGE, le mari, entre, vêtu comme un ouvrier.

La servante, qui avait les yeux levés","La Marquise de Sennertaille, comédie en 1 acte, par MM. Paul Siraudin et P. Marcellus.

TEXTE CORRIGÉ:

","Un mariage sous Louis XV

comédie en 3 actes, par Alex.

Le spectateur se promène dans la forêt de Sénart. Il s'éloigne du logis qu'il vient de quitter, en compagnie de quelques jeunes gens dont le caractère a quelque chose d'exagéré. On le conduit à des lieux qu'il n'avait pas encore aperçus, qui ne sont pas loin d'un bois où se voient une troupe de jeunes gens en chapeau, c'est-à-dire en chapeau de paille, qui font la cour à des jeunes femmes. Un de ces jeunes gens s'approche du spectateur et lui demande la permission d'en faire l'épreuve.

_Au lecteur._

Nous aimerons croire que vos peines et vos labeurs, messieurs les auteurs dramatiques, n'ont pas été vains. Nous ne le croyons pas. Nous croirons que vous aurez produit, et produit un beau jour, des ouvrages qui aient un sens, une suite, une idée. Nous l'espérons. Nous le désirons. Mais jusqu'à ce moment, laissez la liberté de parler à ceux qui peuvent et doivent se faire l'organe de vos productions. Ce que nous vous avons à reprocher, ce n'est pas vos ouvrages,","La Marquise de Sennertaille, comédie en 1 acte, par MM. Paul Siraudin et P. Marcellus.

","LA VIE DE NAPOLÉON, récit en un acte.

Un jeune, dans la nuit, au fond d'une maison, éternue et se secoue; il prend le parapluie, monte sur un rocher qui domine la mer, écarte le parapluie et contemple l'espace.

La nuit est calme, la mer est calme, l'espace est calme; et ces trois calmes donnent l'aspect de silence au tableau. Le soleil se lève.

La matinée de la vie, quand l'existence commence pour tous, quand l'existence finit pour certains. Le jeune se tourne vers l'Occident, se met à suivre de l'oeil","La Marquise de Sennertaille, comédie en 1 acte, par MM. Paul Siraudin et P. Marcellus.

Au pied d’une statue, à la lisière d’un bois,
S’entretenant, un personnage vêtu de blanc et un autre vêtu de noir.

Le premier personnage.

« La vie est un songe dont le destin semble devoir 

poursuivre le cours. Mais une seule chose, au travers de ce sommeil, 

s'élève comme un phare, un homme, et voici que ce phare brille. 

Vous l'aimez, vous vous jetez à son cou; mais la nuit se lève,

","LE BARBIER DE SÉVILLE, comédie en 4 actes.

ACTE I.

Scène première. Une salle dans une auberge.--DON CÉSAR DE BORBON, et ses deux valets, à droite.

BORBON, _très ému._

C'en est fait, mes amis, tout est fini.--Je suis ruiné, et je suis déshonoré.

ESTÉVEZ.

Vous avez un peu trop bu, monseigneur, ou vous vous êtes mis en colère; on ne devrait pas être déshonoré de n'avoir pas pu payer une auberge; cela est trop vulgaire.

_1er ACTE._

On voit par le milieu d'un bois une tente d'où partent des rayons qui s'élèvent et s'étendent dans l'air comme des éclairs, le Cid, sur un siège de marbre, et à ses côtés un vieillard, et près de lui un jeune homme; le soleil se lève à gauche.

_L'on voit le roi Rodrigue, dans sa tente de campagne,
à côté de ses pages_ (_les autres pages sont couchés_),
_et à côté de ses femmes_.

Leloir lui fît faire la comédie qu’il avait à la main, le jour où l’on donnait la fête au Ministre de la police. L’idée de M. Leloir lui avait frappé la tête au moment même où le Ministre venait de prononcer sa dernière parole en prenant congé du spectacle.

D'ailleurs, je me sentais tellement dans l'impuissance, tant j'étais faible en face de ses volontés, que je me révoltais intérieurement contre mon obéissance, car ce n'était plus une obéissance, et je le savais bien.

","Avant de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua.


C'était hier soir à la fin de votre réunion avec le Président de la Commission, quand nous nous séparâmes. Nous n'aurions dû qu'un baiser. Un dernier sourire. Mais je ne le sais ni lui ni moi, et je m'effraye des effets de ce mauvais mouvement.

Je vous écrivais un mot à l'instant de votre départ. Il ne vous parvint jamais. C'est vrai que je ne vous en pries pas pour le faire. Si vous me pardonnez, j'en écrirai un autre demain.

## Différents types de textes

Il existe deux types de texte à corriger:

1. Un texte de documentation historique (document à corriger) dont le contenu est déjà connu.
2. Un document à corriger dont le contenu est inconnu (on ne connaît que la valeur qui doit être remplacer l'écriture).

## La documentation historique

Les document à corriger ont une valeur historique et/ou doccumentaire. Ils sont à corriger pour conserver cette valeur historique et/ou documentaire.

Soudain une tête surgit d'un trou et un bras lui lit signe d'approcher. - C'est nous, fit Régnier, où est le poste? - Y en a pas, répondit une voix, on est tassés dans un gourbi! Couché presque à plat ventre, Régnier se raunJa dans l'exca-vation. - C'est maigre, miladious! murmura-t-il, enQn.! Accroupi, ramassé sur lui-même, 11 établit tant bien que mal sa communication. - Allo! caporal Legrand, c'est vous?. C'est Régnier qui est à l'appareil. Bon. ça marche. Vous dites?. Ah! oui, je crois que le climat n'est pas sain, vu l'humidité. J'ai peur de prendre racine. Je me sens déjà des fourmis dans les jambes. Al-lons, bonne nuit, caporal. - Dites donc, vous n'êtes pas là pour faire la causette, fit brusquement un adjudant, fermez ça une fois pour toutes.
