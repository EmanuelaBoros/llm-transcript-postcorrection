When his wife saw that he had so soon ended his business, she thought him a profitable servant, and said little but left him alone.

He got up early in the morning and went to the field. As soon as his master was ready, he took his man's breakfast and came to the field, intending to help Rush. However, the moment he left his house, the Priest came to see his wife, and she prepared some good food for them to enjoy together. While it was being prepared, they sat playfully together, demonstrating many loving gestures.

So they were both released from their danger. They, being not contented with this trial of their skill, went further in their conjurations and raised up two spirits, one for each of them. Bungye charged his spirit to assist him with the greatest power it had so that he might be able to overcome Vandermast. The Devil told him he would if he would give him just three drops of blood from his left arm. But if he denied him that, then Vandermast would have power over him to do whatever he liked. Vandermast's devil likewise told him the same. To this demand of the spirits, they both agreed, thinking they would overcome each other, but the Devil overthrew them both. Having given the Devil this blood, as mentioned before, they both fell again to their conjurations. First, Bungye raised Achilles with his Greeks, who marched about Vandermast and threatened him. Then Vandermast raised Hector with his Trojans, who defended him from Achilles and the Greeks. Then began a great battle between the Greeks and Trojans, which continued for a good while. At last, Hector was slain, and the Trojans fled. Then there followed a great tempest with thunder and lightning, so that the two conjurers wished they had been away.
