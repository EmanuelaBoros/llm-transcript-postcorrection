Of Friar Bacon, 243 George fought with the dragon and killed it. Vandermast, following his example, raised up Perseus, who fought also with his sea-monster and killed it. Thus, they were both released from their danger.

And when the great prince of devils, which are the patrons of all vices, understood the great misrule and vile living of these religious men, they consulted to keep them still in that state, and worse if it might be. And these are the names of the devils: Belphegor, who was Prince of Gluttony; Asmodeus, Prince of Lechery; and Belzebub, Prince of Envy, along with many other devils assembled together, which rejoiced at the disorder of these religious men. And as they were all assembled together with one accord, they chose a devil to go and dwell among these religious men in order to maintain them the longer in their ungracious living. This devil was put in clothing like an earthly creature and went to a religious house, where he stood at the gate for a certain time, all alone with a heavy countenance.

The young man, with great reverence, answered, ""Sir, I am a poor young man, and am out of service, and would like to have a master. And sir, if it pleases you to have me, I shall do diligent service and shadow so well that you and all your brethren and convent shall be glad of me, for I shall keep your secrets so well that I trust to obtain your good love and favor, and all theirs also.""

Cette crise fut plus longue que celle qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès. Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'effet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà profondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au docteur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé.

Cette crise fut plus longue que celle qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès. Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'effet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà profondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au docteur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé.

Point d'excuse possible, rien qui puisse pallier ce commen-cement de trahison. Vous aviez été pour moi le meilleur, le plus dévoué et le plus fidèle des amis vous n'aviez qu'une pensée, mon bonheur qu'un but, notre union. Jamais, c'est une justice que je me plais à vous rendre, aucun chagrin ne m'est venu de vous si j'exprimais un désir, vous vous em-pressiez de le satisfaire si j'avais un ennui, vous vous offriez à le partager. Vous étiez de ces loyaux compagnons qu'une femme est trop heureuse de rencontrer dans sa vie, qui l'as-sistent dans les bons et les mauvais jours et se donnent sans réserve comme sans calcul.

Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie. Tâchez d'en venir à bout et j'incli-nerai ma science devant la vôtre. L'aimez-vous ? - Si je l'aime 1 Vous me demandez si je l'aime!

XXXV Cette crise fut plus longue que ceile qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès. Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie. Tâchez d'en venir à bout et j'incli-nerai ma science devant la vôtre. L'aimez-vous ? - Si je l'aime 1 Vous me demandez si je l'aime! Ne le voyez-vous pas ? - Eh bien 1 alors, il y a quelque chance pour que vous réussissiez. Mais, ou je me trompe fort, ou ce sera une cure difficile. Cet entretien avait lieu à voix si basse, que rien n'en pou-vait parvenir aux oreilles de Marguerite, et, pourtant, il se fit chez elle un mouvement singulier.

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solùment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. - Monsieurl s'écria-t-il, Monsieur! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. - Où allez-vous, Monsieur? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait ehez qui ils allaient. - Où je vais? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. - Comment, je le vois? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. - J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. - Votre camarade? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous 1 - Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dtlt-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin.

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solûment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. -Monsieur! s'écria-t-il, Monsieur ! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. -J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. -Votre camarade ? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous ! -Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dût-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif ? Voilà à quelles impressions je cédai sans m'en rendre bien compte, ni pénétrer trop avant dans mon coeur Peut-être, hélas ! en interrogeant mieux ce coeur, aurais-je trouvé le dernier mot de ces réticences. La suite ne l'a que trop prouvé j'étais déjà touchée, j'entrais dans cette série de faiblesses qui m'ont perdue. C'est ici que j'ai besoin de votre pardon, Ludovic, d'un pardon absolu et généreux. Point d'excuse possible, rien qui puisse pallier ce commen-cement de trahison. Vous aviez été pour moi le meilleur, le plus dévoué et le plus fidèle des amis vous n'aviez qu'une pensée, mon bonheur qu'un but, notre union. Jamais, c'est une justice que je me plais à vous rendre, aucun chagrin ne m'est venu de vous si j'exprimais un désir, vous vous em-pressiez de le satisfaire si j'avais un ennui, vous vous offriez à le partager. Vous étiez de ces loyaux compagnons qu'une femme est trop heureuse de rencontrer dans sa vie, qui l'as-sistent dans les bons et les mauvais jours et se donnent sans réserve comme sans calcul. Je voyais tout cela, je le sentais et ne méconnaissais point vos mérites. Lui, au contraire, qu'était-il et quel fonds

Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie.

And when Friar Rush saw that they were fighting together, he immediately blew out all the candles and lamps that were burning in the church, leaving no light by which one might see the other. When he had done so, he took his truncheon in his hand and went into the choir among the thickest of the friars, who were fighting fiercely without light.
