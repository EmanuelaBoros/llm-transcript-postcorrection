I got out, because of fear, wanting to be saved, from which Hermann wrote 'ἐξερρυσάμην'. 532. Ajax has the angry thought in mind, which Tekmessa expresses, but he can't bring it to the lips, which is why he breaks off after 'κακοῖσιν'. 534. It was appropriate given the present situation and my own hands to build the child's tomb. The genitive with 'ngenov' is based on analogy with 'ἄξιον', like Plat. Menex. 239 c πρεπόντως τῶν πραξάντων.

CORRECTED TEXT:",Agamemnon makes an announcement to Odysseus.,"Agamemnon macht dem Odysseus den Vorwurf des Wankelmuts, da er doch früher mit ihm gegen Ajax gestanden habe.

CORRECTED TEXT (with translation): Agamemnon reproaches Odysseus for his fickleness, although he had previously stood with him against Ajax.","Lage der Dinge ihnen abfallen, gelten den Leuten für unzuverlässig. Agamemnon macht dem Odysseus den Vorwurf des Wankelmuts, da er doch früher mit ihm gegen Aias gestanden habe. (Laur.

Odysseus gibt zu, es komme allerdings vor, dass man bald freundlich sein, bald bitter und unangenehm werden könne. Vgl. 678 HF. Vielleicht will Odysseus sagen, Agamemnon selbst werde jetzt bitter, der doch eben ihn seinen besten Freund genannt hat.
