1. Aegisthus has had a dream in which he saw Orestes standing in the market-place at Athens, and with him are the other Argives. The king fears that he will be assassinated in the night by some of his kinsmen, and so he rises and leaves the house.
The same thing happened to Aias the king, who was lying in his chamber, for the same fear possessed him. And he rose and, going outside the gates, came to the place of sacrifice, where the people had gathered together.
Aias saw a serpent lying asleep in the sacrificial cleft and thought that some misfortune would come of this, and he killed it; but the serpent was not really asleep, but was feigning sleep to entice him to kill it. For when Aias was dead, the men of Argos, who had been planning mischief, and had gone from their homes with swords concealed, took the man, brought him into the hall of his father, and killed him.
But Orestes, hearing that the king had left the city, came to it in a boat with his comrades.

1. Aegisthus has had a dream in which he saw Orestes standing in the market-place at Athens, and with him are the other Argives. The king fears that he will be assassinated in the night by some of his kinsmen, and so he rises and leaves the house.
The same thing happened to Aias the king, who was lying in his chamber, for the same fear possessed him. And he rose and, going outside the gates, came to the place of sacrifice, where the people had gathered together.
Aias saw a serpent lying asleep in the sacrificial cleft and thought that some misfortune would come of this, and he killed it; but the serpent was not really asleep, but was feigning sleep to entice him to kill it. For when Aias was dead, the men of Argos, who had been planning mischief, and had gone from their homes with swords concealed, took the man, brought him into the hall of his father, and killed him.
But Orestes, hearing that the king had left the city, came to it in a boat with his comrades.

1. Aegisthus has had a dream in which he saw Orestes standing in the market-place at Athens, and with him are the other Argives. The king fears that he will be assassinated in the night by some of his kinsmen, and so he rises and leaves the house.
The same thing happened to Aias the king, who was lying in his chamber, for the same fear possessed him. And he rose and, going outside the gates, came to the place of sacrifice, where the people had gathered together.
Aias saw a serpent lying asleep in the sacrificial cleft and thought that some misfortune would come of this, and he killed it; but the serpent was not really asleep, but was feigning sleep to entice him to kill it. For when Aias was dead, the men of Argos, who had been planning mischief, and had gone from their homes with swords concealed, took the man, brought him into the hall of his father, and killed him.
But Orestes, hearing that the king had left the city, came to it in a boat with his comrades. The men of Argos met him and killed him with their swords.</s>",LLAMA-2-7B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,el,results-ajmc_mixed-meta-llama-Llama-2-7b-hf.jsonl,1223,0.9714285714285714,0.1111111111111111,-0.8856209150326798,80-99%,1.0,0.08695652173913043,-0.9130434782608696,99-100%,0.9435813573180704,0.18973561430793157,-0.7989197085800691,80-99%,-0.8658613672912061,Negative Improvement

Sentence 1: ��","2 Tim. 3:9 εν καιρῷ τοῦ κρισεως και τοῦ θερισμου αυτου: the gen. is more usual here, and","cc. of a transitive verb. 6544 σεμορόν. This word is used only by Homer for the couch in which the corpse is laid. In the case before us the expression σεμορομένοις πεπλοῖς λέγεται may perhaps be compared to νεφελοφόροις (Il. 2. 610). The plural in 671 is either a plural of respect, or a plural of the object. In the former sense it would mean ‘favouring the man who is to bear the child.’ In the latter sense, it would mean ‘which he should receive for his wife’s sake’; i. e., for bringing the child up. The use of the plural of respect is favoured by the fact that in 677 τῶν σεμορωμένων παιδικῶν γενεαίων is used for ‘the ages of boys.’ For the word παιδικὸς cp. Ph. 1047 τοὺς ἀρχαῖους παιδικοὺς γενεαίους. The use of the plural object is confirmed by ἑρπετὰς δὲ ἔχουσαν (943). In the last clause περίτραπον is properly an attributive, but it has also, in the genitive, the sense ‘by which the child is born.’—τετράγων. The word is a compound of τέτρα and χώγω. Cp.

Incorrect text: 165 n","cc. of a transitive verb. 6544 σεμορόν. This word is used only by Homer for the couch in which the corpse is laid. In the case before us the expression σεμορομένοις πεπλοῖς λέγεται may perhaps be compared to νεφελοφόροις (Il. 2. 610). The plural in 671 is either a plural of respect, or a plural of the object. In the former sense it would mean ‘favouring the man who is to bear the child.’ In the latter sense, it would mean ‘which he should receive for his wife’s sake’; i. e., for bringing the child up. The use of the plural of respect is favoured by the fact that in 677 τῶν σεμορωμένων παιδικῶν γενεαίων is used for ‘the ages of boys.’ For the word παιδικὸς cp. Ph. 1047 τοὺς ἀρχαῖους παιδικοὺς γενεαίους. The use of the plural object is confirmed by ἑρπετὰς δὲ ἔχουσαν (943). In the last clause περίτραπον is properly an attributive, but it has also, in the genitive, the sense ‘by which the child is born.’—τετράγων. The word is a compound of τέτρα and χώγω. Cp. Eustath. on Il. 8. 419. 6571. A different reading: ἵνα μετὰ κατεκτούντων αὐτόν ἐξ ὀπίσω θοῤῥῆσκε. If the first τὰ is retained, the verb is to be taken intransitively, and the phrase would mean, ‘in such a position that I shall see him when I arrive.’ The best reading is τὰ δὲ θοῤῥῆσκε with τὰ ἐξ ὀπίσω as in Il. 3. 330, where the object-acc. occurs. In the last clause θαλὰμ would be best translated ‘bed",LLAMA-2-7B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,el,results-ajmc_mixed-meta-llama-Llama-2-7b-hf.jsonl,1123,0.75,0.2127659574468085,-0.7163120567375887,60-80%,1.0,0.17391304347826086,-0.8260869565217391,99-100%,0.828761429758936,0.21511627906976744,-0.7404364255557369,80-99%,-0.7609451462716882,Negative Improvement
