Ce chapitre est composé d'un court résumé de l'histoire de la Grèce et de","faire en sorte que la grande femme ne le vît pas une seule fois avant la fin de sa vie. Je ne m'expliquai point les mouvements subits de son coeur, je l'accusai d'inconsidération, je lui arrachai la barbe, je le menai en conseil, je m'en prit à son insolence, je le traitai de périmé, de vieillard, de nigaud et tout ce qu'on peut imaginer. Je voulais le faire taire, le mettre à la porte ou le chasser du logis tout simplement. Elle m'en empêcha. La grand'mère ne m'écoutait point elle n'était pas de mon avis je ne pouvais la raisonner elle l'accusa, par son côté, d'excès de zèle elle disait qu'il n'y avait rien de plus touchant que cette sorte de tendresse que les hommes se donnaient entre eux dans leur adolescence. ""Ce n'est ni la peur ni l'envie qui vous rend la barbe grise,"" me dit-elle, ""et les autres hommes ne font pas attention à cet engouement qui défigure leurs coeurs."" Ce n'était pas, à vrai dire, l'engouement qui le rendait gris j'étais trop émue moi-même pour s'attarder là-dessus. Melchior, après ce qu'il venait de faire, ne pouvait me revoir et passer le reste de ses jours auprès de moi, que je ne me dé-con-solais de la chute qui m'était annoncée. Il y avait quelque chose de trop fort, de trop violent et de trop bien inspiré dans son aventure, pour qu'elle ne le rendit pas, d'un coup, plus beau, plus attrayant qu'il ne l'avait jamais été. C'était de l'égoïsme et de la malice que j'étais coupable, je me mis à trembler à l'idée que le mystère ne lui plairait point et que la grand'mère s'en irait, et, comme elle ne le supportait pas, lui laissât pour tout héritage son neveu. Il y avait bien plus d'un mois qu'elle ne m'avait rien dit de ce côté-là, et la pression de l'aîné la poussait à en faire le plus tôt possible. Mais, enfin, il y eut un beau matin un entretien comme à l'ordinaire, et, dès que je fus sortie, j'entendis la grand'mère demander de l'eau-de-vie. Je m'en vins au-devant d'elle, et, la prenant à la main, je l'invitai à venir à sa chambre, je voulais lui dire des mots de consolation. Elle refusa, elle se plaignait, elle avait, sans moi, un certain genre de vie; elle disait qu'elle y fêtait son anniversaire, et qu'elle n'y tiendrait pas plus longtemps. Je lui fis remarquer que le médecin ne voulait pas que le petit vît le soleil, mais elle me répliqua qu'il la rendrait bien malheureuse si elle n'avait pas l'occasion de faire la paix avec Dieu.

The text is a 19th-century version of the 16th-century text that was transcribed and published by John Russell, as part of The Chronicles of Froissart. It is a translation of an account of the life and travels of the Frenchman Jean Froissart (1337 - 1410). The text is a collection of historical writings that covers the period from 1327 to 1405. Froissart's chronicles are a mixture of true historical material, fiction, and mythology. He includes many legends and fantastical stories, often exaggerated or embellished by the tale-teller. In his day, Froissart was a successful writer, but his tales have become outdated. Modern historians believe that they are mostly fictional and unreliable.

Il avait bien veillé. C'était le fils, il était sorti. Il ne voulait pas dire son nom. Il avait perdu son père, et il avait laissé passer un an. Il avait été reçu à son arrivée dans cette capitale, le 1er août, à l'hôpital des malades de la peste. La vie lui avait paru si belle, qu'il avait voulu y de-rouler à son tour. Il avait fait les deux premiers mois le tour de la ville, pour en profiter, avant d'entreprendre son activité. Le 1er décembre, il était malade, mais malade depuis longtemps. Il ne pouvait plus se lever. Depuis cette époque, il s'était tenu couché comme un oiseau prisonnier. Il ne se croyait pas responsable de l'incendie, il voulait le nier jusqu'à la fin. On l'avait arrêté. Il l'avait prévu, et il m'en avait avertie.

Il avait été reçu à son arrivée dans cette capitale, le 1er août, à l'hôpital des malades de la peste. La vie lui avait paru si belle, qu'il avait voulu y de-rouler à son tour. Il avait fait les deux premiers mois le tour de la ville, pour en profiter, avant d'entreprendre son activité. Le 1er décembre, il était malade, mais malade depuis longtemps. Il ne pouvait plus se lever. Depuis cette époque, il s'était tenu couché comme un oiseau prisonnier. Il ne se croyait pas responsable de l'incendie, il voulait le nier jusqu'à la fin. On l'avait arrêté. Il l'avait prévu, et il m'en avait avertie. Melchior avait été placé dans une chambre où il pouvait parler à mon oreille, et je n'avais pas manqué de lui faire connaître la situation du fils.

Il faut si. peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui ! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, -on puise des mo-tifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant- de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul mais une force impérieuse et presque indépen-dante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons? La chose en valait-elle la peine? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ?

Mais j'ai cru savoir son nom, et je me crois forcée de vous le dire, car je vous le dois, et pourtant il m'est impossible de vous dire celui que j'ai oublié. Que si je n'avais jamais eu de lui d'autre pensée que celle du bien qu'il me rendait, -que si je n'avais que l'intérêt de mon bonheur à voir s'en servir, j'eusse pu négliger tout autre soupçon. Ma faute est venimeuse parce qu'elle vient de moi. Tout mon malheur est dans cet amour naïf que j'avais pour lui. J'ai voulu le protéger, l'excuser, oublier ses torts, et, n'aimant plus qu'à l'aimer, je l'ai caché dans la honte et dans le crime. -Il m'était facile d'en savoir plus. Il me semblait que cette croyance n'avait que trop d'infidélité pour ne pas être fausse. Et, en me sentant si facile à la duper, -ses manœuvres semblaient bien plus suspectes. Cependant, il m'est impossible de ne pas en avoir senti un peu, j'en ai fait mes remontrances, et mon esprit, dans sa confiance naïve, m'a toujours conseillé de prendre le plus près ce que je vois et de ne rien laisser à l'imagination. Ce soir-là, je croyais encore être en bon chemin. Le désir que vous avez d'en être quitte, la vive et juste indignation dont vous vous êtes fait l'écho, l'aveu d'un passé d'infidélité que j'ai été pour ainsi dire forcée d'admettre, tout me le prouve et me fait connaître mon erreur. Pourquoi me laisse-tu devoir en taire davantage? pourquoi me refuses-tu d'en dire plus? A-t-il été moins coupable que je le croyais? ou n'y avait-il pas dans ses manœuvres, et peut-être même dans ses sentiments, une grande naïveté qui ne voulait pas laisser paraître la moindre liaison et qui s'était crue, -par une illusion toute féminine, dans l'impression qu'elle faisait, et dans une indiscrétion, d'après laquelle l'attention et le plaisir venaient à sa place et à sa place seule. Pourquoi, Ludovic, pourquoi refuses-tu d'en dire davantage et laisse-t-il que la preuve de tout cela se fasse par moi seule. Dès qu'il s'agit de mes torts, de mon ingratitude, de mon abandon et d'un autre crime de plus grande portée, j'ai le courage de l'avouer, mais vous, qu'a-t-il fait à vous pour que je vous en parle en premier, et que je vous aie réservé la honte de ce que j'ai eu le courage d'avouer moi-même?

And when Frier Rush heard those words, he was well pleased that he had done so well, for he thought never any Friar was able to have performed such a deed as he had done there that day, for there fell so many Friers in their fights and skirmishes, that they were as many as they were in the Quier, when all together there. So when he had heard that sentence, he kneeled down before the Judge, and besought his clemency in his most humble wise, and told him he would never offend again in that kind. And that he hoped when ever they came to fight again, they would beware to come together in the Quier. And so his punishment was that he should sit down in the Quier all the rest of the day, and should be shent with the Quier for his disobedience, and also that he should pay ten shillings for his rasing up of the deske, and other ten shillings for the light that he had burned there, and ten other shillings for beating up the Friers of the Quier, and also that he should never fight with a truncheon, nor with any such manner of weapon, in any place that belonged to the Church. Then the Judge took away the light out of his hand, and set him down in the Quier, and there he remained till all the rest were come from their fight, and then the Judge went his way.

The following description of a famous tournament, held at York, in the month of August 1571, was written, in French, by the Baron d'Autry, who was a member of the French Court.

Simpson, and the copy of the British Museum was printed by Richard Breton. In fact, I cannot find any evidence that either edition was re-printed or reprinted, which seems somewhat unusual. The London copy has on the title-page the words ""newly corrected."" This is of course the old form of the word ""re-corrected,"" and the words seem to me to refer to an examination of the proof-sheets by Bishop Andrewes, who was then Master of Westminster School.

Tales in the Old Style, by Aphra Behn (1683)
Few people today would wish to be known as a ""lady,"" for it is assumed to be an uncomplimentary term. In the past, however, this word denoted a woman of gentle breeding and manners, who was ""a lady"" in the sense that she was a member of the aristocracy, and was one of the ""better sort."" The word ""gentlewoman"" was used in the same sense, while ""gentleman"" was used to denote a member of the ""better sort"" in the male gender. A lady or a gentlewoman, however, had to be ""well-born,"" for a woman of gentle birth who married a grocer or a draper was not ""a lady"" in the popular sense. The word ""lady"" was also used to designate a respected woman in her own right, or a woman who did not have to marry to become respected.

Few people today would wish to be known as a ""lady,"" for it is assumed to be an uncomplimentary term. In the past, however, this word denoted a woman of gentle breeding and manners, who was ""a lady"" in the sense that she was a member of the aristocracy, and was one of the ""better sort."" The word ""gentlewoman"" was used in the same sense, while ""gentleman"" was used to denote a member of the ""better sort"" in the male gender. A lady or a gentlewoman, however, had to be ""well-born,"" for a woman of gentle birth who married a grocer or a draper was not ""a lady"" in the popular sense. The word ""lady"" was also used to designate a respected woman in her own right, or a woman who did not have to marry to become respected. Many ""ladies"" were ""in trade,"" while the daughter of a country gentleman might be expected to earn her living by some activity of her own, such as sewing, for example.
