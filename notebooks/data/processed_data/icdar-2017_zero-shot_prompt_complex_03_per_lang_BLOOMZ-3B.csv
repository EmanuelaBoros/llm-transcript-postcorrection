Il faut si. peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui ! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, -on puise des mo-tifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant- de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul mais une force impérieuse et presque indépen-dante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons? La chose en valait-elle la peine? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, .comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif? Voilà à quelles impressions je cédai sans m'en rendre bien compte, ni pénétrer trop avant dans mon coeur Peut-être, hélas ! en interrogeant mieux ce coeur, aurais-je trouvé le dernier mot de ces réticences. La suite ne l'a que trop prouvé j'étais déjà touchée, j'entrais dans cette série de faiblesses qui m'ont perdue. C'est ici que j'ai besoin de votre pardon, Ludovic, d'un pardon absolu et généreux.

Et sans se rebuter il continua, s'adressant à des poilus qui tiraillaient quelques cartouches. - C'est les téléphonistes. - Ah, les embusqués! chuchotèrent les hommes. - Oui, embusqués de première ligne comme vous autres, répondit Régnier rageusement, et il continua à questionner - Le poste téléphonique? - Taisez-vous, souffla un sergent, nous sommes à vingt mètres des Boches! Soudain une tête surgit d'un trou et un bras lui lit signe d'approcher. - C'est nous, fit Régnier, où est le poste? - Y en a pas, répondit une voix, on est tassés dans un gourbi! Couché presque à plat ventre, Régnier se raunJa dans l'exca-vation. - C'est maigre, miladious! murmura-t-il, enQn.! Accroupi, ramassé sur lui-même, 11 établit tant bien que mal sa communication. - Allo! caporal Legrand, c'est vous?. C'est Régnier qui est à l'appareil. Bon. ça marche. Vous dites?. Ah! oui, je crois que le climat n'est pas sain, vu l'humidité. J'ai peur de prendre racine. Je me sens déjà des fourmis dans les jambes. Al-lons, bonne nuit, caporal. - Dites donc, vous n'êtes pas là pour faire la causette, fit brusquement un adjudant, fermez ça une fois pour toutes. Le mieux pour lui était de ne pas répliquer, car il se sentait dans une atmosphère hostile. Les deux soldats qui partaient, sans plus tarder, mirent leuss sacs, s'éloignèrent sur une poignée de main. - Ce n'est pas confortable là dedans, soupira le Méridional assis en tailleur. j'ai des crampes dans tes genoux, mais ce qui me console, c'est que je ne paie pas mon loyer! La nuit s'annonçait assez tranquille, fatigués par les atta. ques des jours précédents, les Allemands paraissaient plutôt inquiets qu'agressifs. Insensible et brisé de fatigue. Buchard s'était endormi. Seul Régnier veillait et comme il n'avait personne à qui parler, 11 s'élait mis à manger un morceau de singe et vidait ce qui lql restait de pinard.

Encore un effort et ses ennemis vont s'arrêter, bien sûr il n'oseront pas le poursuivre si près de la maison. En tout cas, il y arrivera le premier ! Le petit Edouard se trompait. La poursuite continuait. Mais Édouard était rentré dans le jardin. Toute sa famille était là qui l'appelait, qui le cherchait. Son père était sur la plate-forme du perron. Les domestiques effarés couraient partout avec des lanternes. Chacun criait Édouard, Édouard! La voix de sa soeur venait jusqu'à lui. Papa ! papa ! s'écria Édouard, cher papa ! je suis là !

Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu, il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de -cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et ses ennemis vont s'arrêter, bien sûr il n'oseront pas le poursuivre si près de la maison. En tout cas, il y arrivera le premier ! Le petit Edouard se trompait. La poursuite continuait. Mais Édouard était rentré dans le jardin. Toute sa famille était là qui l'appelait, qui le cherchait. Son père était sur la plate-forme du perron. Les domestiques effarés couraient partout avec des lanternes. Chacun criait Édouard, Édouard! La voix de sa soeur venait jusqu'à lui. Papa ! papa ! s'écria Édouard, cher papa ! je suis là ! Et le petit Édouard tombait à moitié mort de peur dans les bras de son père. Mais il n'arrivait pas seul. Les voleurs, les gendarmes, tous ses ennemis, tous ses persécuteurs, animés sans doute, eux aussi, par leur course, avaient franchi la porte du jardin et faisaient effrontément irruption dans le salon en sonnant une fanfare éclatante.

14 L'ANE GRIS En ce moment, et, comme si elle eût répondu à son appel, la cloche de la maison paternelle retentit dans les airs. Était-ce bien possible, est-ce qu'il ne serait encore que l'heure du coucher?. Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu, il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de -cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et ses ennemis vont s'arrêter, bien sûr il n'oseront pas le poursuivre si près de la maison. En tout cas, il y arrivera le premier ! Le petit Edouard se trompait. La poursuite continuait. Mais Édouard était rentré dans le jardin. Toute sa famille était là qui l'appelait, qui le cherchait. Son père était sur la plate-forme du perron. Les domestiques effarés couraient partout avec des lanternes. Chacun criait Édouard, Édouard! La voix de sa soeur venait jusqu'à lui. Papa ! papa ! s'écria Édouard, cher papa ! je suis là ! Et le petit Édouard tombait à moitié mort de peur dans les bras de son père. Mais il n'arrivait pas seul. Les voleurs, les gendarmes, tous ses ennemis, tous ses persécuteurs, animés sans doute, eux aussi, par leur course, avaient franchi la porte du jardin et faisaient effrontément irruption dans le salon en sonnant une fanfare éclatante. Le croirait-on? mais la vérité nous oblige à le confesser la troupe des fantômes devant laquelle avait fui l'intrépide Édouard se composait d'un seul malfaiteur!. son petit âne, qui, en se trouvant tout à coup au milieu des lumières du salon, avait cru devoir célébrer son entrée par le plus beau braiement qui fût jamais sorti de son gosier.
