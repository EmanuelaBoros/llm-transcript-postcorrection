Melchior avait ce don il s'em-parait des gens et ne lâchait prise que lorsque cela lui con venait. Ce fut de lui-même qu'il prit congé. Nous nous étions abordés en ennemis nous allions nous quitter les meilleurs amis du monde. Non pas qu'il y eut là-dedans quelque chose de sérieux ni de dangereux pour vous mais ce bon vivant avait jeté sur notre intérieur un peu de vie et de mouvement il avait fait rire ma grand'mère, il l'avait tenue éveillée sans effort et heureuse de cette distraction. Je lui savais gré de cela, et en retour j'oubliai complétement les petits ennuis qu'il m'avait autrefois causés, ses impertinences, ses airs évaporés, ses pipes, ses cravates et sa barbe. Il gagnait à être vu de près et y reprenait tous ses avantages. De toute la soirée, il ne lui échappa rien qui pût blesser mes oreilles, ni contrarier la révolution qui s'opérait en moi. Il se contint, il s'observa d'une manière parfaite jusqu'au moment où il nous quitta. J'étais loin de m'attendre à la surprise qu'il me ména-geait.

I'm trying to write a function that returns all the `p` elements of a DOM element. In this case, there are 6 `p` elements. However, it is only returning 2 elements, the second set of `p` elements.

Answer: If you want to iterate over \em{all} `p` tags, you have to use [`document.querySelectorAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll) and iterate through its results with [for..of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of).","{{TEXTE}}

Dans le cas des lettres écrites, l'enregistrement des signes de ponctuation est très fréquemment correctible,","Le premier livre, celui de 1598, est parvenu jusqu'à nous en l'état, et le manuscrit ayant été donné à M. de V. en 1674, nous ne savons pas quel manuscrit il a dû remplacer.

","Les Américains ont l’habitude de se servir du terme _bona fide_ pour signifier qu’ils ont agi légalement.

```
                         VOUS ÉTES UNE BIEN FIDÈLE, PEUT-ÊTRE.
```

Un homme est _bona fide_ quand il est dévoué, loyalement et
véritablement aux idées, des convictions et des intérêts qu’il
représente. Un _bona fide_ homme d’affaires est un homme qui
ne s’engage pas dans des transactions commerciales qu’il ne veut pas
mener à bien.

Le front est une haute ligne de marbre noir, d'énormes rochers, de taches de sable, et de brèches crevées par l'eau salée de l'Ethra. Et plus loin, la barrière grise des nuages d'argile qui entourent les monts d'Érin.

Answer: This code will take the text and then paste it into a PDF file, I believe you just want to use the `pdftex` driver with the option `shell:yes` like this:

et un officier français.

Des papiers qu'il étudie un moment

Et puis il les dépose dans sa main gauche.

Le lieutenant lève les yeux.

Il regarde le capitaine, il regarde les papiers,

Il lève encore une fois les yeux,","TEXTE CORRIGÉ:

TEXTE CORRIGÉ:

","D'après un article de l'historien américain Frederick Jackson Turner publié en 1893 dans le magazine The American Historical Review, l'histoire des États-Unis se divise en deux périodes : la période de la colonisation et l'ère de la nation. Les colonies américaines sont créées au début de l'ère moderne, au XVIe siècle, et leur population a grandi rapidement, principalement grâce à des colons européens. Ceux-ci n'arrivent pas à s'adapter et doivent développer des cultures originales.

Il ne s'agit pas d'une guerre prochaine, mais bien d'une guerre lointaine, et la chose n'est pas due à la presse des États-Unis. Le gouvernement est bien assez capable de se défendre de lui-même, et cela depuis longtemps déjà. Le gouvernement a le droit de se défendre, mais il a le devoir de se défendre.

La presse est la tribune de la parole publique.","Le prince Louis de Condé a été tué, par les soldats de la Ligue, dans la bataille de Jarnac, le 7 mars 1569, âgé de vingt-six ans, ce qui a déplu beaucoup au duc de Guise et à tous ses amis, en raison du caractère inculte de la guerre civile que ce jeune homme se voulait entretenir.

### Déclaration sur la Guerre du Yémen

« La chute du gouvernement du Yémen du Sud en 2014 a provoqué des affrontements entre les forces gouvernementales et le mouvement Houthi, ce qui a provoqué un conflit ouvert avec la Ligue arabe et les États-Unis qui soutiennent les forces gouvernementales. Il a conduit à la bataille du port d'Hodeïda en mai 2015, qui a déclenché l'opération Tempête décisive. Des combats ont également eu lieu à Taïz. »

### Déclaration sur la Guerre du Yémen

« La chute du gouvernement du Yémen du Sud en 2014 a provoqué des affrontements entre les forces gouvernementales et le mouvement Houthi, ce qui a provoqué un conflit ouvert avec la Ligue arabe et les États-Unis qui soutiennent les forces gouvernementales. Il a conduit à la bataille du port d'Hodeïda en mai 2015, qui a déclenché l'opération Tempête décisive. Des combats ont également eu lieu à Taïz. »

Then anon the Priour came into the Quier, and sate him downe in his place, and as he looked about him, he espied that the Subpriour was there present, and with that his heart began to grudge of the olde anger that was fallen betweene them two, and he thought in his minde that he could never be revenged in a better time, and sodainly he rose out of his place, and went to the Subpriour, and with his fist he gave him a good buffet, and the Subpriour which was moved with the stroke, started unto the Priour and gave him another buffet, and with that they went freshly together by the eares, and when the other Friers saw that, every man rose out of their places, and drew out their Truncheons, and together they went who","Please assist with reviewing and correcting errors in texts produced by automatic transcription (OCR) of historical documents.

so that it seemed in the Quier like a mickle battle, and there was much great clamouring, so that it seemed that there was a warre betwixt the whole Convent. The Friers, therefore, began to keepe their places, and every man, according to the place where he was, was determined to defend his ground to the last, and the Friers had all their Truncheons in their hands, which they held as they could keep them, and began to blow them very loudly. And then in all haste, each of them called out to them that stood about him to help them, and one called out to another, as every man did that he could, and every man gave the other help, and they had so stiffe a heart to do the Priours wrong, that no man durst in all that place show any mercy. The Priour was very sore wounded, and his face was almost bloody, and the Subpriour was so hurt in the face, that his eyen were as white as milk, and he was so sore wounded that he thought himself ready to die.

Then the Priour and Subpriour ran to their lodgings, and the Friers followed them afterward with their Truncheons, but they would have them no farther, but they fled to their Lodgings, where they might the better be helped. There was an old Priour, a man very well known for his long age, who came into the Quier, and he saw all this great trouble, and he went unto the Priour and said unto him, ""Most noble Priour, I am an old man, and I have lived in this world these many years, and I have seen all the world, and I know that in all times and places, when men be wrought in a high mind, as it is in this case, it is almost impossible that they should be governed, and therefore I am sure that this Convent of religious men is like to go to wrech, unless I can be a meanes that this Trouble be ended. 274 Now I have in my mind to go unto this Subpriour, and to bring him to thee, if thou wilt be ready to forgive him that hath done thee this wrong, and to make him friends with thee, as I have brought him to thee, and to send him again into",LLAMA-7B,prompt_complex_lang,prompt_complex_03_per_lang,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-decapoda-research-llama-7b-hf.jsonl,1543,0.9890260631001372,0.5984251968503937,-0.39493485644391535,80-99%,0.9765377298668357,0.32073595226255597,-0.6715580540791878,80-99%,-0.5332464552615516,Negative Improvement

CORRECTED TEXT:","But wishes were in vain for now the time was come, that the Devil would be paid for the knowledge that he had

Answer: That looks fine to me, although the OCR software may have produced some of the typographic errors.

The Devil was paid in this passage, presumably by the person wishing for knowledge that he did not have.

Answer: It seems the OCR did its job correctly.

The first line says the wishes were in vain, but it was in vain as the time had come and the Devil (possibly literally) was paid.

It's just a typo.","OF FRYER BACON.
