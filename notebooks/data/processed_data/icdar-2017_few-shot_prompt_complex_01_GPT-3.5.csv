Puis s'adressant à cette aïeule qui avait si saintement vécu et si saintement fini, à sa mère moissonnée avant le temps et qui, son mari mort, avait, elle aussi, manqué de courage, elle les conjura sans doute d'intercéder pour elle et d'obtenir qu'elle fût admise à leurs côtés, dans le séjour des âmes pures ou purifiées par le repentir. Elle leur demanda d'unir leurs prières à la sienne afin d'en augmenter l'effet et d'ob-tenir ce pardon qui descend d'en haut sur les coeurs humi-liés et sincères. Quand elle eut mis sa conscience en paix, autant que le permettait l'acte violent auquel elle était résolue, elle monta sur son lit, ajusta ses vêtements de manière à ce que rien n'y pût amener du désordre, s'étendit sur les coussins, et, s'emparant d'une petite fiole qui était à sa portée, elle l'ap-procha de ses lèvres. Quelques minutes après, elle était plongée dans un en-gourdissement profond.","Correct the spelling and grammar of the following incorrect text from an optical character recognition (OCR) applied to a historical document:

Édouard s'assit sur l'herbe et appuya sa tête contre le flanc de l'âne. Ils restèrent ainsi un moment en silence, écoutant les bruits du soir, le chant des oiseaux, le murmure du vent et le lointain tintement de la cloche.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes. Les deux hommes s'en allèrent sans se soucier de lui, emmenant leur âne gris.",GPT-3.5,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,few-shot,results-3few-shot-icdar-2017-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl,3588,1.0,1.0,0.0,99-100%,0.9858136300417246,0.18812709030100336,-0.8091656631963581,80-99%,-0.40458283159817904,Negative Improvement

Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie.

Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes. Les deux hommes s'en allèrent sans se soucier de lui, emmenant leur âne gris.",GPT-3.5,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,few-shot,results-3few-shot-icdar-2017-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl,3588,1.0,1.0,0.0,99-100%,0.9858136300417246,0.18812709030100336,-0.8091656631963581,80-99%,-0.40458283159817904,Negative Improvement

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes.

Était-ce bien possible? Est-ce qu'il n'était encore que l'heure du coucher? Sans s'en douter, Édouard avait fait le tour du parc au lieu d'aller tout droit par l'allée du milieu. Il avait tourné sur lui-même et était revenu à son point de départ. C'était bien là la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait à sonner. Sans doute on s'était aperçu de son absence. Ce second coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Encore un effort et il serait devant son père, devant sa mère, sur le seuil de leur demeure chérie. Il se mit à courir. Mais il n'alla pas bien loin. À deux pas de la porte, il s'arrêta court, laissant échapper un cri de surprise et de douleur. Un âne gris, tenu par une longue corde, était planté en travers de la route. Édouard ne l'avait pas vu venir, il s'était précipité dessus à corps perdu et avait roulé avec lui, entraîné par l'élan. L'âne n'avait pas bronché. Couché sur le sol, Édouard se mit à rire d'une façon nerveuse. L'âne gris le regardait de ses yeux mornes. Les deux hommes qui le tenaient en laisse se mirent à rire aussi. Édouard se releva. Il était sale, couvert de poussière et d'herbe. Son linge était déchiré, sa cravate pendait. Il était méconnaissable. Les deux hommes continuèrent de rire, mais Édouard, agité de spasmes, pleurait maintenant à chaudes larmes. Les deux hommes s'en allèrent sans se soucier de lui, emmenant leur âne gris.",GPT-3.5,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,few-shot,results-3few-shot-icdar-2017-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl,3588,1.0,0.96875,-0.03125,99-100%,0.9858136300417246,0.18812709030100336,-0.8091656631963581,80-99%,-0.42020783159817904,Negative Improvement

Mais en même temps, il avait promis de venir à l'Ange-Gardien, et il avait gardé pendant toute la journée l'espérance de voir Made-in. Cette espérance ne se réalisait pas encore. Que faire? Édouard eut une idée. S'il entrait dans la maison paternelle, il allait certainement se heurter à quelque mécontentement, à quelque reproche. S'il allait à l'Ange-Gardien, il risquait tout au plus une réprimande. Il pourrait dire qu'il était allé chercher des nouvelles de son oncle Charles qui était souffrant, et que, l'ayant trouvé endormi, il n'avait pas voulu le réveiller, ce qui expliquait son retard.
