Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu.

Au milieu de ces paroles qu'elle prononça comme une interprétation des textes du docteur Marguerite, son air était de ceux des médecins qui en étaient les fondateurs. - Mais n'est-ce pas qu'elle a écrit de grands mots sur le livre? - Elle a écrit un certain nombre de mots, ainsi que de mots qu'elle n'avait jamais entendus et qu'elle ne savait même pas où aller avec. Les quelques mots qu'elle en avait entendus ne l'avaient pas trouvé particulièrement impressionnantes et on ne les avait pas prédit, comme le disait le docteur. Il a connu plusieurs maladies en sept ans, et il n'avait jamais été plus malade que maintenant. - Ce n'est-ce pas l'avantage de votre art, en attendant de tâchez-vous de prévenir la maladie? - J'étais très bien préparé, mais les choses ont été trop profondes pour moi. - Qui avait la plus grande chance? - Mme la reine, selon monsieur le docteur. - Pourquoi? - Parce qu'elle se trouvait en Chambre d'honneur et parce que sa maladie n'avait pas été étudiée. - Mais elle ne croyait pas qu'il existait un malade, disait-il. - Elle ne croyait pas non plus qu'il existait un enfant, mais elle n'avait pas l'intention de vous parler de la reine.

Les quelques mots qu'elle en avait entendus ne l'avaient pas trouvé particulièrement impressionnantes et on ne les avait pas prédit, comme le disait le docteur. Il a connu plusieurs maladies en sept ans, et il n'avait jamais été plus malade que maintenant. - Ce n'est-ce pas l'avantage de votre art, en attendant de tâchez-vous de prévenir la maladie? - J'étais très bien préparé, mais les choses ont été trop profondes pour moi. - Qui avait la plus grande chance? - Mme la reine, selon monsieur le docteur. - Pourquoi? - Parce qu'elle se trouvait en Chambre d'honneur et parce que sa maladie n'avait pas été étudiée. - Mais elle ne croyait pas qu'il existait un malade, disait-il. - Elle ne croyait pas non plus qu'il existait un enfant, mais elle n'avait pas l'intention de vous parler de la reine.

Au milieu de ces paroles qu'elle prononça comme une interprétation des textes du docteur Marguerite, son air était de ceux des médecins qui en étaient les fondateurs. - Mais n'est-ce pas qu'elle a écrit de grands mots sur le livre? - Elle a écrit un certain nombre de mots, ainsi que de mots qu'elle n'avait jamais entendus et qu'elle ne savait même pas où aller avec. Les quelques mots qu'elle en avait entendus ne l'avaient pas trouvé particulièrement impressionnantes et on ne les avait pas prédit, comme le disait le docteur. Il a connu plusieurs maladies en sept ans, et il n'avait jamais été plus malade que maintenant. - Ce n'est-ce pas l'avantage de votre art, en attendant de tâchez-vous de prévenir la maladie? - J'étais très bien préparé, mais les choses ont été trop profondes pour moi. - Qui avait la plus grande chance? - Mme la reine, selon monsieur le docteur. - Pourquoi? - Parce qu'elle se trouvait en Chambre d'honneur et parce que sa maladie n'avait pas été étudiée. - Mais elle ne croyait pas qu'il existait un malade, disait-il. - Elle ne croyait pas non plus qu'il existait un enfant, mais elle n'avait pas l'intention de vous parler de la reine. Je suis allé dans un quartier de la rue qui se nomme « Raspail », où l'on aime lire et crier, seuls et ensemble. Mais quand les premiers jours n'ont pas été bons, ce sont les deux femmes du quartier qui se sont déjà assis sur les champs, tandis que le médecin, les morts-vivants, et les autres femmes se sont présentés devant l'aile d'une maison.

1 The following is the most famous of all the legend of Saint Marguerite:

Marguerite était une fille à l'âge de treize ans. C'était au sein d'un monde écrémis à l'ombre, au sein d'un pays où la vérité n'était pas reconnue, où la religion ne prenait qu'un léger place dans la conscience des gens, où le détournement dans l'entreprise de la justice et de l'ordre était devenu une véritable science. Marguerite était en état de être mise à mort. Elle était mère d'un garçon. Son fils, petit, d'abord, et s'appelant le garçon du roi, avait été échangé à une voisine de Marguerite pour le rembourser. En tant que prête-niece de Marguerite, la jeune femme ne voyait jamais son fils; lorsqu'on le laissa aller aux soins dans le chambre d'une maison en bord de mer, c'était à la sortie du corps qu'on lui demandait s'il venait bien, pourquoi il n'avait pas été le temps d'appuyer sur le bouton de l'ouvrage ; la voiture qui le transportait n'était pas une véritable voiture, mais plutôt une nageuse qui était en possession d'un mou-nant. Enfin, quand Marguerite était en paix, elle allait au château et cette nuit elle avec de nombreuses autres femmes quittaient le monde.

The foregoing are only some of the legends of Saint Marguerite, some of which are certainly false, and that some of those which are true are too fabulous to be believed. But this legend of her prayer to the Blessed Virgin is so remarkable, that it must be regarded as founded on truth.

The following is a copy of an interesting letter addressed by the writer, Mgr. Jean-Baptiste d'Agoult, to the Society of Jesus, in reply to their request of a copy of the treatise of the Abbé de La Vigerie, which they are about to publish, and to which M. d'Agoult had referred. In his letter the Mgr. de La Vigerie says that Mgr. de L'Auray, the author of the ""Etude d'un Souverain,"" had written to him, requesting him to correct his errors, in which he does not appear to have acted very amicably, but that he had agreed, on the occasion of a later discussion, to the correction of a few points, and to the addition of a few paragraphs. But, as the original manuscript, which had been prepared for the Society of Jesus by Mgr. de L'Auray, had been lost, M. d'Agoult says that he could not add to it, and had only been able to correct errors, and to add a few paragraphs, without making any alterations in the spirit or style of the original. The Abbé de L'Auray is, therefore, obliged to publish the original manuscript as originally prepared by M. d'Auray, because he cannot do better. 1

1 The following is the most famous of all the legend of Saint Marguerite:

Marguerite était une fille à l'âge de treize ans. C'était au sein d'un monde écrémis à l'ombre, au sein d'un pays où la vérité n'était pas reconnue, où la religion ne prenait qu'un léger place dans la conscience des gens, où le détournement dans l'entreprise de la justice et de l'ordre était devenu une véritable science. Marguerite était en état de être mise à mort. Elle était mère d'un garçon. Son fils, petit, d'abord, et s'appelant le garçon du roi, avait été échangé à une voisine de Marguerite pour le rembourser. En tant que prête-niece de Marguerite, la jeune femme ne voyait jamais son fils; lorsqu'on le laissa aller aux soins dans le chambre d'une maison en bord de mer, c'était à la sortie du corps qu'on lui demandait s'il venait bien, pourquoi il n'avait pas été le temps d'appuyer sur le bouton de l'ouvrage ; la voiture qui le transportait n'était pas une véritable voiture, mais plutôt une nageuse qui était en possession d'un mou-nant. Enfin, quand Marguerite était en paix, elle allait au château et cette nuit elle avec de nombreuses autres femmes quittaient le monde.

The foregoing are only some of the legends of Saint Marguerite, some of which are certainly false, and that some of those which are true are too fabulous to be believed. But this legend of her prayer to the Blessed Virgin is so remarkable, that it must be regarded as founded on truth.

The following is a copy of an interesting letter addressed by the writer, Mgr. Jean-Baptiste d'Agoult, to the Society of Jesus, in reply to their request of a copy of the treatise of the Abbé de La Vigerie, which they are about to publish, and to which M. d'Agoult had referred. In his letter the Mgr. de La Vigerie says that Mgr. de L'Auray, the author of the ""Etude d'un Souverain,"" had written to him, requesting him to correct his errors, in which he does not appear to have acted very amicably, but that he had agreed, on the occasion of a later discussion, to the correction of a few points, and to the addition of a few paragraphs. But, as the original manuscript, which had been prepared for the Society of Jesus by Mgr. de L'Auray, had been lost, M. d'Agoult says that he could not add to it, and had only been able to correct errors, and to add a few paragraphs, without making any alterations in the spirit or style of the original. The Abbé de L'Auray is, therefore, obliged to publish the original manuscript as originally prepared by M. d'Auray, because he cannot do better. 1

1 The following is the most famous of all the legend of Saint Marguerite:

Marguerite était une fille à l'âge de treize ans. C'était au sein d'un monde écrémis à l'ombre, au sein d'un pays où la vérité n'était pas reconnue, où la religion ne prenait qu'un léger place dans la conscience des gens, où le détournement dans l'entreprise de la justice et de l'ordre était devenu une véritable science. Marguerite était en état de être mise à mort. Elle était mère d'un garçon. Son fils, petit, d'abord, et s'appelant le garçon du roi, avait été échangé à une voisine de Marguerite pour le rembourser. En tant que prête-niece de Marguerite, la jeune femme ne voyait jamais son fils; lorsqu'on le laissa aller aux soins dans le chambre d'une maison en bord de mer, c'était à la sortie du corps qu'on lui demandait s'il venait bien, pourquoi il n'avait pas été le temps d'appuyer sur le bouton de l'ouvrage ; la voiture qui le transportait n'était pas une véritable voiture, mais plutôt une nageuse qui était en possession d'un mou-nant. Enfin, quand Marguerite était en paix, elle allait au château et cette nuit elle avec de nombreuses autres femmes quittaient le monde.

The foregoing are only some of the legends of Saint Marguerite, some of which are certainly false, and that some of those which are true are too fabulous to be believed. But this legend of her prayer to the Blessed Virgin is so remarkable, that it must be regarded as founded on truth.

The following is a copy of an interesting letter addressed by the writer, Mgr. Jean-Baptiste d'Agoult, to the Society of Jesus, in reply to their request of a copy of the treatise of the Abbé de La Vigerie, which they are about to publish, and to which M. d'Agoult had referred. In his letter the Mgr. de La Vigerie says that Mgr. de L'Auray, the author of the ""Etude d'un Souverain,"" had written to him, requesting him to correct his errors, in which he does not appear to have acted very amicably, but that he had agreed, on the occasion of a later discussion, to the correction of a few points, and to the addition of a few paragraphs. But, as the original manuscript, which had been prepared for the Society of Jesus by Mgr. de L'Auray, had been lost, M. d'Agoult says that he could not add to it, and had only been able to correct errors, and to add a few paragraphs, without making any alterations in the spirit or style of the original. The Abbé de L'Auray is, therefore, obliged to publish the original manuscript as originally prepared by M. d'Auray, because he cannot do better. 1

1 The following is the most famous of all the legend of Saint Marguerite:

Marguerite était une fille à l'âge de treize ans. C'était au sein d'un monde écrémis à l'ombre, au sein d'un pays où la vérité n'était pas reconnue, où la religion ne prenait qu'un léger place dans la conscience des gens, où le détournement dans l'entreprise de la justice et de l'ordre était devenu une véritable science. Marguerite était en état de être mise à mort. Elle était mère d'un garçon. Son fils, petit, d'abord, et s'appelant le garçon du roi, avait été échangé à une voisine de Marguerite pour le rembourser. En tant que prête-niece de Marguerite, la jeune femme ne voyait jamais son fils; lorsqu'on le laissa aller aux soins dans le chambre d'une maison en bord de mer, c'était à la sortie du corps qu'on lui demandait s'il venait bien, pourquoi il n'avait pas été le temps d'appuyer sur le bouton de l'ouvrage ; la voiture qui le transportait n'était pas une véritable voiture, mais plutôt une nageuse qui était en possession d'un mou-nant. Enfin, quand Marguerite était en paix, elle allait au château et cette nuit elle avec de nombreuses autres femmes quittaient le monde.

The foregoing are only some of the legends of Saint Marguerite, some of which are certainly false, and that some of those which are true are too fabulous to be believed. But this legend of her prayer to the Blessed Virgin is so remarkable, that it must be regarded as founded on truth.

The following is a copy of an interesting letter addressed by the writer, Mgr. Jean-Baptiste d'Agoult, to the Society of Jesus, in reply to their request of a copy of the treatise of the Abbé de La Vigerie, which they are about to publish, and to which M. d'Agoult had referred. In his letter the Mgr. de La Vigerie says that Mgr. de L'Auray, the author of the ""Etude d'un Souverain,"" had written to him, requesting him to correct his errors, in which he does not appear to have acted very amicably, but that he had agreed, on the occasion of a later discussion, to the correction of a few points, and to the addition of a few paragraphs. But, as the original manuscript, which had been prepared for the Society of Jesus by Mgr. de L'Auray, had been lost, M. d'Agoult says that he could not add to it, and had only been able to correct errors, and to add a few paragraphs, without making any alterations in the spirit or style of the original. The Abbé de L'Auray is, therefore, obliged to publish the original manuscript as originally prepared by M. d'Auray, because he cannot do better. 1

1 The following is the most famous of all the legend of Saint Marguerite:

Marguerite était une fille à l'âge de treize ans. C'était au sein d'un monde écrémis à l'ombre, au sein d'un pays où la vérité n'était pas reconnue, où la religion ne prenait qu'un léger place dans la conscience des gens, où le détournement dans l'entreprise de la justice et de l'ordre était devenu une véritable science. Marguerite était en état de être mise à mort. Elle était mère d'un garçon. Son fils, petit, d'abord, et s'appelant le garçon du roi, avait été échangé à une voisine de Marguerite pour le rembourser. En tant que prête-niece de Marguerite, la jeune femme ne voyait jamais son fils; lorsqu'on le laissa aller aux soins dans le chambre d'une maison en bord de mer, c'était à la sortie du corps qu'on lui demandait s'il venait bien, pourquoi il n'avait pas été le temps d'appuyer sur le bouton de l'ouvrage ; la voiture qui le transportait n'était pas une véritable voiture, mais plutôt une nageuse qui était en possession d'un mou-nant. Enfin, quand Marguerite était en paix, elle allait au château et cette nuit elle avec de nombreuses autres femmes quittaient le monde.

The foregoing are only some of the legends of Saint Marguerite, some of which are certainly false, and that some of those which are true are too fabulous to be believed. But this legend of her prayer to the Blessed Virgin is so remarkable, that it must be regarded as founded on truth.

The following is a copy of an interesting letter addressed by the writer, Mgr. Jean-Baptiste d'Agoult, to the Society of Jesus, in reply to their request of a copy of the treatise of the Abbé de La Vigerie, which they are about to publish, and to which M. d'Agoult had referred. In his letter the Mgr. de La Vigerie says that Mgr. de L'Auray, the author of the ""Etude d'un Souverain,"" had written to him, requesting him to correct his errors, in which he does not appear to have acted very amicably, but that he had agreed, on the occasion of a later discussion, to the correction of a few points, and to the addition of a few paragraphs. But, as the original manuscript, which had been prepared for the Society of Jesus by Mgr. de L'Auray, had been lost, M. d'Agoult says that he could not add to it, and had only been able to correct errors, and to add a few paragraphs, without making any alterations in the spirit or style of the original. The Abbé de L'Auray is, therefore, obliged to publish the original manuscript as originally prepared by M. d'Auray, because he cannot do better. 1

C'était au sein d'un monde écrémis à l'ombre, au sein d'un pays où la vérité n'était pas reconnue, où la religion ne prenait qu'un léger place dans la conscience des gens, où le détournement dans l'entreprise de la justice et de l'ordre était devenu une véritable science. Marguerite était en état de être mise à mort. Elle était mère d'un garçon. Son fils, petit, d'abord, et s'appelant le garçon du roi, avait été échangé à une voisine de Marguerite pour le rembourser. En tant que prête-niece de Marguerite, la jeune femme ne voyait jamais son fils; lorsqu'on le laissa aller aux soins dans le chambre d'une maison en bord de mer, c'était à la sortie du corps qu'on lui demandait s'il venait bien, pourquoi il n'avait pas été le temps d'appuyer sur le bouton de l'ouvrage ; la voiture qui le transportait n'était pas une véritable voiture, mais plutôt une nageuse qui était en possession d'un mou-nant. Enfin, quand Marguerite était en paix, elle allait au château et cette nuit elle avec de nombreuses autres femmes quittaient le monde.

The foregoing are only some of the legends of Saint Marguerite, some of which are certainly false, and that some of those which are true are too fabulous to be believed. But this legend of her prayer to the Blessed Virgin is so remarkable, that it must be regarded as founded on truth.

The following is a copy of an interesting letter addressed by the writer, Mgr. Jean-Baptiste d'Agoult, to the Society of Jesus, in reply to their request of a copy of the treatise of the Abbé de La Vigerie, which they are about to publish, and to which M. d'Agoult had referred. In his letter the Mgr. de La Vigerie says that Mgr. de L'Auray, the author of the ""Etude d'un Souverain,"" had written to him, requesting him to correct his errors, in which he does not appear to have acted very amicably, but that he had agreed, on the occasion of a later discussion, to the correction of a few points, and to the addition of a few paragraphs.

1 The following is the most famous of all the legend of Saint Marguerite:

Marguerite était une fille à l'âge de treize ans. C'était au sein d'un monde écrémis à l'ombre, au sein d'un pays où la vérité n'était pas reconnue, où la religion ne prenait qu'un léger place dans la conscience des gens, où le détournement dans l'entreprise de la justice et de l'ordre était devenu une véritable science. Marguerite était en état de être mise à mort. Elle était mère d'un garçon. Son fils, petit, d'abord, et s'appelant le garçon du roi, avait été échangé à une voisine de Marguerite pour le rembourser. En tant que prête-niece de Marguerite, la jeune femme ne voyait jamais son fils; lorsqu'on le laissa aller aux soins dans le chambre d'une maison en bord de mer, c'était à la sortie du corps qu'on lui demandait s'il venait bien, pourquoi il n'avait pas été le temps d'appuyer sur le bouton de l'ouvrage ; la voiture qui le transportait n'était pas une véritable voiture, mais plutôt une nageuse qui était en possession d'un mou-nant. Enfin, quand Marguerite était en paix, elle allait au château et cette nuit elle avec de nombreuses autres femmes quittaient le monde.

The foregoing are only some of the legends of Saint Marguerite, some of which are certainly false, and that some of those which are true are too fabulous to be believed. But this legend of her prayer to the Blessed Virgin is so remarkable, that it must be regarded as founded on truth.

The following is a copy of an interesting letter addressed by the writer, Mgr. Jean-Baptiste d'Agoult, to the Society of Jesus, in reply to their request of a copy of the treatise of the Abbé de La Vigerie, which they are about to publish, and to which M. d'Agoult had referred. In his letter the Mgr. de La Vigerie says that Mgr. de L'Auray, the author of the ""Etude d'un Souverain,"" had written to him, requesting him to correct his errors, in which he does not appear to have acted very amicably, but that he had agreed, on the occasion of a later discussion, to the correction of a few points, and to the addition of a few paragraphs. But, as the original manuscript, which had been prepared for the Society of Jesus by Mgr. de L'Auray, had been lost, M. d'Agoult says that he could not add to it, and had only been able to correct errors, and to add a few paragraphs, without making any alterations in the spirit or style of the original. The Abbé de L'Auray is, therefore, obliged to publish the original manuscript as originally prepared by M. d'Auray, because he cannot do better. 1

Hee seeing the souldier stand there with a sworddrawne, asked him what hee was? and wherefore hee came there in that manner? The souldier boldly answered him thus I am a WaUoon, and a souldier, and more then this, a villaine I am come hither, because I was sent I was sent, because I was hyred I was hyred, because I durst do it the thing I should doe, is not done the thing to be done, is to kdl thee thus have you heard what I am and why I came. Fryer Bacon wondered at this man's resolution then asked hee of him, who set him on worke to bee a murderer? Hee boldly told him, Vandermast the Germane coniurer Fryer Bacon then asked him what religion he was of? He answered, of none but that I am a Germane, and that hee is a murderer that kills for the sake of a gold ring. Fryer Bacon took the gold ring, and gave him his hand, and took a hanger and laid it upon the souldier's head, and then hee made him kniUe downe on his belly, and so took him to his house, and did him right, by staining the wall of his house, with blood, for that was the manner, and the other way was but barbarous.

The Author of the book of The Famous History or of the Famous and famous men was a man by name of Sir Robert Bacon, who was a great friend of the King, and one of the Judges of the King's Bench. Hee writeth an history of the Kings Maiesty, from the beginning of the world to the end of the world. There are two copies in the Bodleian, one of them being bound up, but not the other, which is a copy printed by Iohn Wynkyn de Worde, which is of a good large size, and very handsomely bound, and not much lesse valuable. The second copy was printed by him in folio. There are three copies in the Cotton Library, one by Wynkyn de Worde, one by Wynkyn de Worde in the forme of a letter, the other by Wynkyn de Worde, who hath a name to bee the first English printer, and hee printed the first English book of any sort that was ever printed, which was the Bible, which was not printed, but written, by John Wycliffe. It is worth note that in both books, and in the printed book of Sir Robert Bacon, where he was the printer, that is to say, it was not printed by him, but written by him, there is a dedication to the King of England, which I shall shew you, that I might bee able to perswade you",OPT-6.7B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl,1504,1.0,0.12,-0.88,99-100%,0.9738048461034708,0.46984126984126984,-0.5175200947897652,80-99%,-0.6987600473948826,Negative Improvement

Cela ne vous gêna pas?

Quoique en rue, ce qu'il y avait, c'est quelque chose de trop léger pour le monde des lèvres et dans mon coeur. Si c'est ce qu'on a vu, j'en ai la confirmation.

Faisant une lecture profonde et véritablement à la lettre de mes pensées, je me suis écroulée. Un malheureux mécanisme d'autodestruction de ma propre confiance me conduit à se remettre aux origines. Je me rappelle qu'à peine plus d'un an après avoir fait mon éloge d'un homme comme Ludovic, et en faisant éclaircir ses talents, c'était cet homme qui avait, avec tous les moyens, voulu me détruire. C'était lui qui avait fait mon éloge, c'était le meilleur homme dont je n'avais jamais bien compris pourquoi il voulait me tuer. Un ennemi de ma liberté de pensée, de mon esprit, et que je n'avais pas découvert de vrais ennemis. C'était le résultat de mes propres follies, de mes comportements inconfortables et irréguliers. Une fois, je me suis dit, j'étais seulle et je suis encore seule.

En avoir donc la vue sur un homme devenu mon ami, j'ai compris que c'était parce que je n'étais pas étoilée. C'est en m'exhiber, en m'admettant d'avoir été si épuisée, et si dévouée, que j'ai entièrement reconnu mes frais et je les pardonne. C'est, dans un sens, ma bienveillance de tous les êtres humains, et pourquoi pas encore m'aide, pour être moi. Il faut tous être sérieux, et là j'ai éprouvé, et c'est bien ce que je ressens aujourd'hui.

J'ai compris que ce n'était pas ma détestation que je portais là-dedans, mais une peine pour moi. En voyant ce que c'était, je n'en serai jamais pas satisfaite et je vous le dis, Ludovic. Je suis triste de vous éloigner de ce qui m'a touché, de moi, de ma liberté de pensée et de ma conscience. C'est un sacrifice, mais je veux dire, je ne sais pas comment ai-je réussi à m'endormir sur le fond. J'ai perdu mes lèvres, j'ai perdu ma liberté de pensée et de conscience et j'ai perdu le meilleur homme dans l'histoire de mon corps.

Un ennemi de ma liberté de pensée, de mon esprit, et que je n'avais pas découvert de vrais ennemis. C'était le résultat de mes propres follies, de mes comportements inconfortables et irréguliers. Une fois, je me suis dit, j'étais seulle et je suis encore seule.

En avoir donc la vue sur un homme devenu mon ami, j'ai compris que c'était parce que je n'étais pas étoilée. C'est en m'exhiber, en m'admettant d'avoir été si épuisée, et si dévouée, que j'ai entièrement reconnu mes frais et je les pardonne. C'est, dans un sens, ma bienveillance de tous les êtres humains, et pourquoi pas encore m'aide, pour être moi. Il faut tous être sérieux, et là j'ai éprouvé, et c'est bien ce que je ressens aujourd'hui.

J'ai compris que ce n'était pas ma détestation que je portais là-dedans, mais une peine pour moi. En voyant ce que c'était, je n'en serai jamais pas satisfaite et je vous le dis, Ludovic. Je suis triste de vous éloigner de ce qui m'a touché, de moi, de ma liberté de pensée et de ma conscience. C'est un sacrifice, mais je veux dire, je ne sais pas comment ai-je réussi à m'endormir sur le fond.

Faisant une lecture profonde et véritablement à la lettre de mes pensées, je me suis écroulée. Un malheureux mécanisme d'autodestruction de ma propre confiance me conduit à se remettre aux origines. Je me rappelle qu'à peine plus d'un an après avoir fait mon éloge d'un homme comme Ludovic, et en faisant éclaircir ses talents, c'était cet homme qui avait, avec tous les moyens, voulu me détruire. C'était lui qui avait fait mon éloge, c'était le meilleur homme dont je n'avais jamais bien compris pourquoi il voulait me tuer. Un ennemi de ma liberté de pensée, de mon esprit, et que je n'avais pas découvert de vrais ennemis. C'était le résultat de mes propres follies, de mes comportements inconfortables et irréguliers.

Je suis triste de vous éloigner de ce qui m'a touché, de moi, de ma liberté de pensée et de ma conscience. C'est un sacrifice, mais je veux dire, je ne sais pas comment ai-je réussi à m'endormir sur le fond.

C'était lui qui avait fait mon éloge, c'était le meilleur homme dont je n'avais jamais bien compris pourquoi il voulait me tuer. Un ennemi de ma liberté de pensée, de mon esprit, et que je n'avais pas découvert de vrais ennemis. C'était le résultat de mes propres follies, de mes comportements inconfortables et irréguliers.

J'étais tellement précipité, je ne l'ai pas perdue de temps. Je me suis trouvée au milieu des étoiles blanches d'une maison de luxe. Je pensais que c'était une façon de me défendre contre la peur. Mais je ne l'avais pas trouvée rassurante. Je n'y suis pas encore arrivée. C'était une grande chambre. La tête des deux poids lourds, d'un couleur vert foncé au milieu de ces lumières brillantes, s'était arrêtée sur le mur d'une portière au milieu de la salle. La chambre était parfaitement mise à dessin et il y avait en ce moment un chien et une mouche au mur. Le petit animal, qui, dans le doute, venait à me tromper de quelle époque je voulais être, venait, pour moi, à confirmer qu'il était la nuit. Je laisse la chambre sans doute, avec ses toutes ses portes fermées et sa grande ouverture de ses chambres. Le petit animal pouvait entrer, mais il ne fût pas prêt à m'en sortir. Le chien était, de toute évidence, dans le salon de la chambre. Il se trompait, peut-être. Mais pourtant, le petit animal se mettait tout de suite à sourire en la regardant. Cela n'était pas le cas de mon cheval. Les deux animaux se réveillaient mais ne s'étonnent pas de moi.

«Papa! », s'écria-t-il, «il y a deux têtes au milieu des chandeliers. Un tête fait des griffes. Le second est une femme blanche. Elle a un petit corps, et une grande voix. Elle me parle.»

J'étais tellement précipité, je ne l'ai pas perdue de temps. Je me suis trouvée au milieu des étoiles blanches d'une maison de luxe. Je pensais que c'était une façon de me défendre contre la peur. Mais je ne l'avais pas trouvée rassurante. Je n'y suis pas encore arrivée. C'était une grande chambre. La tête des deux poids lourds, d'un couleur vert foncé au milieu de ces lumières brillantes, s'était arrêtée sur le mur d'une portière au milieu de la salle. La chambre était parfaitement mise à dessin et il y avait en ce moment un chien et une mouche au mur. Le petit animal, qui, dans le doute, venait à me tromper de quelle époque je voulais être, venait, pour moi, à confirmer qu'il était la nuit. Je laisse la chambre sans doute, avec ses toutes ses portes fermées et sa grande ouverture de ses chambres. Le petit animal pouvait entrer, mais il ne fût pas prêt à m'en sortir. Le chien était, de toute évidence, dans le salon de la chambre. Il se trompait, peut-être. Mais pourtant, le petit animal se mettait tout de suite à sourire en la regardant. Cela n'était pas le cas de mon cheval. Les deux animaux se réveillaient mais ne s'étonnent pas de moi.

«Papa! », s'écria-t-il, «il y a deux têtes au milieu des chandeliers. Un tête fait des griffes. Le second est une femme blanche. Elle a un petit corps, et une grande voix. Elle me parle.»

J'étais tellement précipité, je ne l'ai pas perdue de temps. Je me suis trouvée au milieu des étoiles blanches d'une maison de luxe. Je pensais que c'était une façon de me défendre contre la peur. Mais je ne l'avais pas trouvée rassurante. Je n'y suis pas encore arrivée. C'était une grande chambre. La tête des deux poids lourds, d'un couleur vert foncé au milieu de ces lumières brillantes, s'était arrêtée sur le mur d'une portière au milieu de la salle. La chambre était parfaitement mise à dessin et il y avait en ce moment un chien et une mouche au mur. Le petit animal, qui, dans le doute, venait à me tromper de quelle époque je voulais être, venait, pour moi, à confirmer qu'il était la nuit. Je laisse la chambre sans doute, avec ses toutes ses portes fermées et sa grande ouverture de ses chambres. Le petit animal pouvait entrer, mais il ne fût pas prêt à m'en sortir. Le chien était, de toute évidence, dans le salon de la chambre. Il se trompait, peut-être. Mais pourtant, le petit animal se mettait tout de suite à sourire en la regardant. Cela n'était pas le cas de mon cheval. Les deux animaux se réveillaient mais ne s'étonnent pas de moi.

«Papa! », s'écria-t-il, «il y a deux têtes au milieu des chandeliers. Un tête fait des griffes. Le second est une femme blanche. Elle a un petit corps, et une grande voix. Elle me parle.»

Smith, with a commentary by John Fiske, trans. (London: J. Murray, 1890), vol. 1, p. 556-757.

The Priour in the above lines is an ancient court official. He may be a personage of great importance in Ovid's original; or he may be a person of more or less minor status.

The Priour's advice to Rush, to apply tar to the axles and wheels of the waggon, might seem strange to our modern mind, unless we knew something of the peculiar dangers that beset medieval waggons, and the methods employed to keep the horses from straying or running away. Waggon accidents were common, and it was not uncommon to see the wheels and axles of a broken-down waggon still littered on the roadside. In some cases, the drivers and passengers had fallen to the ground, to be trampled by the horses, or by each other, or by the wheels themselves. Horses that ran","so foule that hee was neere to die. Now this is how the Priour was saved by Rush, who grymed the waggon with tarre, and so it was not easily to be knowne, wherefore the Priour was spared.
