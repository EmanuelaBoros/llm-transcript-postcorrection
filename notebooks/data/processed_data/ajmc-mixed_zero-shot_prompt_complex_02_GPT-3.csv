The remaining errors seem to be typos of the Latin words:

KEY TO DISCUSSION:

Transcription of Greek and Latin words written in “modern” (non-classical) languages

Some letters in historical scripts are generally unrecognizable for OCR software. So if you examine a written text and have to correct mistakes made by OCR software, you will need to know how to transcribe ancient Greek, Latin, English, French, German etc. names into the standard classical Latin alphabet. Non-Latin alphabets such as greek or cyrillic shall not be transcribed into Latin but written directly in the script they represent. In case of a greek or Cyrillic text, please transcribe the German translation into the Latin alphabet","IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

NOTES:
1. Verify the correctness of the word in the appropriate lemma form. If no lemma form exists (e.g., a verb from classical Latin but no corresponding verb in the modern language has been covered in the lemmatized word database of the project), transfer the word into the appropriate lemma field, either by using the Editor function modify or getting the help of a lemma from an expert linguist. Be sure to mark the lemma you edited with the date of your action in the field designated for this purpose. Alternatively, you may edit the segment containing the word.

A compilation of the Leges Atticae (now lost) was made about the middle of the 1st century BC by Q. Aelius Donatus, and supplied with an elaborate commentary. There is no reason to suppose that it was identical to the older compilation, but the commentary offers an almost perfectly continuous armoury of detailed information extending to whatever subject is taken up.

Donatus divided his work into six books called ""tomes"" in imitation of the six books of the popular Greek lexicon of Alexander of Tralles (metaphrasis means transmutation), and each ""tome"" was further divided into several ""books"", thus corresponding to the ""books","IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

CORRECTED TEXT:","offers a philosophical and rhetorical challenge.
Those aliens, who land on Earth after a long journey do not demonstrate human emotions, and in their behaviour they are reminiscent of logical machines. Their reactions lack persuasive power and are calculated by a long-lasting analytical activity. The crew (or the expedition) of an interstellar ship is the only human social group to lack affectivity where all the members are part of it by necessity and not by free will.
In this future when a man's life span extends up to centuries, loneliness is an unfortunate experience that only teenagers get to experience. The old, and in particular, terrestrials, are accustomed to it, but immigrants do not lose the memory of the long journey they made in order",adfero.,"IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

CORRECTED TEXT:","λήν ἐρήμην Conon. Narr. II. πολλήν γῆν Xenoph. Eph.


Perhaps the most difficult aspect is the reconstruction of the strange word written before ""ήρήμην"". In the following, three possible alternatives are considered and discussed.

a) The word is most probably to be reconstructed as ὄρους. This solution was proposed by Kaibel and followed by later vase-describers and other scholars until the suggestion of άνθήμων exactly more than a cen tury ago (Chantre, De Ridder 1903; Bursche, 1931/32; Treu, 1976; Rückert, 1983; Bonfante, 1985; Bosnakis,","Narr.

The correction is explained by the INSERTED (between tags) and REPLACED (between tags) sequences of words. In the example above, the sequence of letters ""arca"" in the incorrect text (in segments from 17 to 19) is replaced by the sequence of letters ""combustus"" in the corrected text (in segments from 21 to 23).

To assure that the changes introduced by the user are reflected in the original file, place the INSERTED and REPLACED text between tags <ins> ... </ins> . For example, to correct the example shown above, start by copying all the text from the very beginning of the file (including the body and","IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

NOTES:
1. Verify the correctness of the word in the appropriate lemma form. If no lemma form exists (e.g., a verb from classical Latin but no corresponding verb in the modern language has been covered in the lemmatized word database of the project), transfer the word into the appropriate lemma field, either by using the Editor function modify or getting the help of a lemma from an expert linguist. Be sure to mark the lemma you edited with the date of your action in the field designated for this purpose. Alternatively, you may edit the segment containing the word.

2. If the text consists of a sequence of words in ancient languages like Ancient Greek and Latin","Verbum κατηναρισμένας ex hoc.

A compilation of the Leges Atticae (now lost) was made about the middle of the 1st century BC by Q. Aelius Donatus, and supplied with an elaborate commentary. There is no reason to suppose that it was identical to the older compilation, but the commentary offers an almost perfectly continuous armoury of detailed information extending to whatever subject is taken up.

Donatus divided his work into six books called ""tomes"" in imitation of the six books of the popular Greek lexicon of Alexander of Tralles (metaphrasis means transmutation), and each ""tome"" was further divided into several ""books"", thus corresponding to the ""books","IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

AUTOMATIC REASONING ENGINE
The availability of several important books on both logic and argumentation has sparked progress in automating reasoning.

These include:

These books include information about argumentation schemes and often templates for both developing an argument step-by-step and identifying counter-arguments. Automation programs were put forward later in the books. Below are some examples.

Perhaps the most advanced of such tools is PromLog, a Propositional Logic reasoner. PromLog features forward, backward and equisatisfiable inference. A recently published paper discusses how to use PromLog to automatically prepare compound statements and insert unspoken premises automatically into arguments.","IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

1. A Geological Introduction to the Stratigraphical Museum, W. C. Johnson, 1836: http://www.archive.org","Still our beautiful earth is mutable and

lives only on account of the sun, which receives

this burden, and incessantly bathing her in rays

and burning her up drives the moisture out.

With this view is Strato's[1] exposition of

melting, viz. that earth in great part

emerged out of water. And against this

the present seas around us, abundantly

storing the earth, are potent testimony,

metals (?). But how if water increased in

quantity while earth became scarce,

could the latter become clearer, as though","IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

NOTE: The general opinion of the modern interpreters is that this diagram represents an evidently different, and far feebler, eclipse, of the Sun entering into the Moon, round about noon, near the time of the solstice. This solcte is shown by hypotheses, with 23° + 29/30th, or nearly 30, towards the Macrobii. The large section is the"" Nadir "" of both the Sun and Moon; and the other section, parallel to the first, is the horizon of the place where the Eclipse happened.

Your task is to carefully examine the following text and correct any mistakes introduced by the OCR software. The text to be corrected comes from a classical commentary; it is written mainly in a modern language (English, French, German or Italian) and can contain sequences of words in ancient languages (Ancient Greek and Latin). The text to be corrected appears after the segment ""TEXT TO CORRECT:"". Please place the corrected version of the text after the ""CORRECTED TEXT:"" segment.

NOTES:
1. Verify the correctness of the word in the appropriate lemma form. If no lemma form exists (e.g., a verb from classical Latin but no corresponding verb in the modern language has been covered in the lemmatized word database of the project), transfer the word into the appropriate lemma field, either by using the Editor function modify or getting the help of a lemma from an expert linguist. Be sure to mark the lemma you edited with the date of your action in the field designated for this purpose. Alternatively, you may edit the segment containing the word.

Those aliens, who land on Earth after a long journey do not demonstrate human emotions, and in their behaviour they are reminiscent of logical machines. Their reactions lack persuasive power and are calculated by a long-lasting analytical activity. The crew (or the expedition) of an interstellar ship is the only human social group to lack affectivity where all the members are part of it by necessity and not by free will.

Perhaps the most difficult aspect is the reconstruction of the strange word written before ""ήρήμην"". In the following, three possible alternatives are considered and discussed.

a) The word is most probably to be reconstructed as ὄρους. This solution was proposed by Kaibel and followed by later vase-describers and other scholars until the suggestion of άνθήμων exactly more than a cen tury ago (Chantre, De Ridder 1903; Bursche, 1931/32; Treu, 1976; Rückert, 1983; Bonfante, 1985; Bosnakis,","Narr.

The correction is explained by the INSERTED (between tags) and REPLACED (between tags) sequences of words. In the example above, the sequence of letters ""arca"" in the incorrect text (in segments from 17 to 19) is replaced by the sequence of letters ""combustus"" in the corrected text (in segments from 21 to 23).

To assure that the changes introduced by the user are reflected in the original file, place the INSERTED and REPLACED text between tags <ins> ... </ins> . For example, to correct the example shown above, start by copying all the text from the very beginning of the file (including the body and","IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

Meskhety-Shomu analyzed the overall documentary character of the papyrus and proposed to re-edit the text in its consistency as whole, providing several parallel versions in Ancient and Modern Egyptian, Revillout’s French translation, Borghouts’ Dutch translation, John Brugman’s English translation, Friedrich Blass’s Latin translation, Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin’s and Roland Kahlke’s German translations, and a technical transcription. He equates the start of line 18 after obverse XIX, line 1 with the end of line 16.

CORRECTED TEXT:","But what about now that he treats so unfairly against Caesar and me, he who did neither wish nor commanded anything base, but being indeed styled a friend, he was ready to die to give testimony with us not to exhibit any decadence in those things that most would threaten to insult us about? This is shameful, there is no impediment, and if you allow what it is necessary to interpret, it is to dispel the clouds. What is it forbids a man to hide what you will not tell? and if this conversation portrays in dirt, then one believes it would like to mean that it is necessary to hide.",Aglaoph.,"IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

He points out, for example, that in areas where the latifundia were worked by slaves the latifundia owners were more likely to support Ghibelline positions. This is because in such areas the latifundia owners feared is a slave rebellion far likelier than the subject populations saw in increased tax burdens and control from the Ghibelline cities.","IV. 1. _Κ_αὶ ἄρᾳ μὲν τὸ μέγ^ε^ ἐβάπτι-σας, sc. τὸ ζῆλον τὸ μὴ δεικνύν, φιλέων ^αβεα^εα^ε^ τοῖός εἰμι ὥσπ^ερ cle ἐν νίουσι πiγ^υ ῷαί^ερος φω^Ι τίμησ^ν : αὐτόθ^ΐ τε agddev. 2.

GENERAL POINTS ON CORRECTING THE TRANSLATION:


There are 10 types of errors: misspellings; wrong conjugation of verbs; wrong declensions of nouns in Latin; errors in proper or common nouns; inability to interpret single Greek or Latin expressions; substitutions; refusal to recognize correct grammatical or syntactic structures and to correct them; refusal to proceed to completion; overlooking mistakes at the completion stage; inadequate knowledge of orthography and/or grammar of Greek, Latin, French, German and/or Italian by means of which to interpret a given translation.

It is our opinion that cataloguing the multiplication of errors would suffice for reassessment and correction of texts. We presume this method to be more appropriate for automatic translations than any kind of dogmatic","Hellanicus



Commentator says the names derive from early times of writing -- the ""er"" and ""u"" were transposed, confusing language translations, such as c.f. AEGPR and PREC -- early Greece was reflected as a backwards-writing language.

The Patriarchal cross is a form of the crucifix (not to be confused with the palm-branch cross) which is a perpendicular cross that (in Russian Orthodox tradition) has the ends of its crossbeams often decorated with acanthus leaves.

GENERAL POINTS ON CORRECTING THE TRANSLATION:


There are 10 types of errors: misspellings; wrong conjugation of verbs; wrong declensions of nouns in Latin; errors in proper or common nouns; inability to interpret single Greek or Latin expressions; substitutions; refusal to recognize correct grammatical or syntactic structures and to correct them; refusal to proceed to completion; overlooking mistakes at the completion stage; inadequate knowledge of orthography and/or grammar of Greek, Latin, French, German and/or Italian by means of which to interpret a given translation.

It is our opinion that cataloguing the multiplication of errors would suffice for reassessment and correction of texts. We presume this method to be more appropriate for automatic translations than any kind of dogmatic","598 (or rather which).

This essay, on the whole, adequate in the main points of criticism of Lipsius’ theses, overlooks many important features of the passage, partly owing to its interpretative impotence in the main lines, and partly owing to too critical an attitude of mind, inasmuch as on page 520 the essayist fails to perceive a play on words (ἔτγετο) in the transition from (I would add, taken up by Joel Adams and Harry Francis Glasscock) from ὁ γιγγύριος to τιθεμένος.

A complete list of works attributed to Plotinus (about sixty titles) exists in the Ennestcus's treatise Porphyrium c. Cels. (PG 17, 657F-668A). The catalogue is probably too big and obviously includes works not written by Plotinus as he was the author of: (1) Enneades/Nine discourses; (2) Propria quaestiones/Original questions; (3) Excerpta de principiis/Excerpts of principles; (4) and (5) Qusestiones nullius notae aetatis/Questions of an uncertain antiquity, which must be previous to Enneades/Nine discourses.

NOTES:

A complete list of works attributed to Plotinus (about sixty titles) exists in the Ennestcus's treatise Porphyrium c. Cels. (PG 17, 657F-668A). The catalogue is probably too big and obviously includes works not written by Plotinus as he was the author of: (1) Enneades/Nine discourses; (2) Propria quaestiones/Original questions; (3) Excerpta de principiis/Excerpts of principles; (4) and (5) Qusestiones nullius notae aetatis/Questions of an uncertain antiquity, which must be previous to Enneades/Nine discourses. At least some of Enneades are older",,"252 βοῶνται <οὐ> δύνανται: ἀμφὶ δὲ μαλακοῖς με|γάλων μῦθος ἔπος <ἀζήτει μᾶ|λλον, ἵνα τιμὴν θνητοῖς λάβῃ μοᾷ|λινοὶ ναῶν, ὥσπεῖ ἔρχονται νεκρό|ν γένος· <οὐδὲ> βέλη ἄτλατον ὄργανα λαμπρὰ | τῶν ἐν ὀμμάτἐσ |τινι στή|θη ἔχοντα | ὄντων πίσυνος ὅτι νῦν φαντάζει θνητὸ|ς ἔρως, η΅νος ἔσται ἠγνή, καίτοι μὴ ὄ|μμα φανείη.

Now, in such cases, the brain is activated by concitatus and so it has to be ever-ready and constantly alert.

But, as soon as it becomes cool, it is no more hot. On the contrary, coldness is ineradicable from it, so that is why it becomes difficult to cool off.

III. MODALITY.

Modals:(a) the first mood, placed between an auxiliary and the main verb, serves as the medium of certainty, and expresses a reality or a degree of likelihood in the action.

""He came "" is necessary"""",

when the person or thing acted upon by the action, is limited in some way.

Every time the optative mood is valid for the propositions.

(b) The simplest use of the subjunctive is for second and third persons forms of the Infinitive, where the choice for subjunctive, future indicative, or Optative is determined by certain context.

Similarly he represents Pallas as dirty: in fact, in everything he says about her he contrives that she should appear the nastiest of the deities. He gives Pallas a sickle.

Although previous papers have been published on this matter (e.g., Dalrymple, Jeffery 1990, Cordon, Konisberg 1997), electronic publication seems to be an effective way for collating large corpora and, despite the problems caused by the instability of 1st and 2nd century cuneiform tablets, ensures wide exchange among professionals. The main problem of this table is the starting phase of the corpus: although it brings together readings of different tablets, there are not sufficient other data to build conclusively a text corpus. The digital record dates back to the 1990s, when new readings were first published on the Internet.

(""Digitally Prepared by Samuel Green, University of California, Irvine."")","She knows, too, that it is dangerous in his presence to acknowledge the gods as supreme over him.

The following classical commentary from the Byzantine Empire period was produced by a medieval hand writing in a mixture of Latin and Greek. Modernists in the first part of the 20th century did not hesitate to correct even the commas within the manuscript by hand, especially as the two parts of the manuscript, each almost 2 m long, are written on rollers of the 20th-century typewriting machine. Be as conservative as necessary (that is, do not correct what it possible even assuming that very conservative attitude) when correcting the following text, or hide the text from Anyangyura if you refuse to do corrections (what is undesirable).

CORRECTED TEXT:","She reproaches him through language with reference to himself. She reproves him by hinting at the fact that what had happened to him could be a warning to others.
This is also true for her personal vulnerability: when, at the end of the story, Edward proposes to her, Bella refuses ""she had not intended to form any new ties of such a kind"". The limits to loves are insuperable, and","‘Since I came into wedlock with thee.’ [9] ‘My thoughts are wholly for thy good.’ [11] As she is one with him, she feels that she has a right to speak of what concerns them both.

The first corrector sought to eliminate ellipses and to minimise confusion between correct and incorrect words. Their explanatory notes are shown between square brackets. Words originally in Greek are marked with the letter ""g"", words in Latin with ""l"". Right and left brackets are used for textual notes and for marginal glosses, beginning each with the letter ""m"", and translated words are marked with ""tr"": [tr]. Longer annotations provide the corrector's insights and conjectures. Information about the original document in the form of a title and a date, found in a header or in the <desc /> element of the XML file, is ignored for markup reasons; an example is:

IKings reconsidered: I have often been struck by the importance of naming in the figure of the king of Israel, or even of the king of Judah in I and II Kings. David was called from tending sheep and Ammon was called to be king with Helaman residing in Jershon among the Ishmaelites in Helaman 8.


In David’s first speech to the elders who met with him about seeing the king’s face, he solved the epistemological problem of how to see no one at the time and communicate with the king’s staff when the king could speak only with the priest Abiathar as Niclot reported to him. David asked the elders:


»Who is it exactly that you want to ‘see the king’s face’ (?)? It doesn’t sound to me as if you are here to offer David the prince a sacrificial present, which reminds me of our own traditions. Wouldn’t he be incapacitated if you performed such an act? If the occasion for your coming is to treat the princess Michal with this offering, Abishai, my favorite son, will perform the task since he is the one Michal, my first born, loves best ».

iKINGS and Masculinity

IKings reconsidered: I have often been struck by the importance of naming in the figure of the king of Israel, or even of the king of Judah in I and II Kings. David was called from tending sheep and Ammon was called to be king with Helaman residing in Jershon among the Ishmaelites in Helaman 8.


In David’s first speech to the elders who met with him about seeing the king’s face, he solved the epistemological problem of how to see no one at the time and communicate with the king’s staff when the king could speak only with the priest Abiathar as Niclot reported to him. David asked the elders:


»Who is it exactly that you want to ‘see the king’s face’ (?)? It doesn’t sound to me as if you are here to offer David the prince a sacrificial present, which reminds me of our own traditions. Wouldn’t he be incapacitated if you performed such an act? If the occasion for your coming is to treat the princess Michal with this offering, Abishai, my favorite son, will perform the task since he is the one Michal, my first born, loves best ».

iKINGS and Masculinity


Helene Foley


IKings reconsidered: I have often been struck by the importance of naming in the figure of the king of Israel, or even of the king of Judah in I and II Kings. David was called from tending sheep and Ammon was called to be king with Helaman residing in Jershon among the Ishmaelites in Helaman 8.


In David’s first speech to the elders who met with him about seeing the king’s face, he solved the epistemological problem of how to see no one at the time and communicate with the king’s staff when the king could speak only with the priest Abiathar as Niclot reported to him. David asked the elders:


»Who is it exactly that you want to ‘see the king’s face’ (?)? It doesn’t sound to me as if you are here to offer David the prince a sacrificial present, which reminds me of our own traditions. Wouldn’t he be incapacitated if you performed such an act? If the occasion for your coming is to treat the princess Michal with this offering, Abishai, my favorite son, will perform the task since he is the one Michal, my first born, loves best ».

IKings reconsidered: I have often been struck by the importance of naming in the figure of the king of Israel, or even of the king of Judah in I and II Kings. David was called from tending sheep and Ammon was called to be king with Helaman residing in Jershon among the Ishmaelites in Helaman 8.


In David’s first speech to the elders who met with him about seeing the king’s face, he solved the epistemological problem of how to see no one at the time and communicate with the king’s staff when the king could speak only with the priest Abiathar as Niclot reported to him. David asked the elders:


»Who is it exactly that you want to ‘see the king’s face’ (?)? It doesn’t sound to me as if you are here to offer David the prince a sacrificial present, which reminds me of our own traditions. Wouldn’t he be incapacitated if you performed such an act?

iKINGS and Masculinity


Helene Foley


IKings reconsidered: I have often been struck by the importance of naming in the figure of the king of Israel, or even of the king of Judah in I and II Kings. David was called from tending sheep and Ammon was called to be king with Helaman residing in Jershon among the Ishmaelites in Helaman 8.


In David’s first speech to the elders who met with him about seeing the king’s face, he solved the epistemological problem of how to see no one at the time and communicate with the king’s staff when the king could speak only with the priest Abiathar as Niclot reported to him. David asked the elders:


»Who is it exactly that you want to ‘see the king’s face’ (?)? It doesn’t sound to me as if you are here to offer David the prince a sacrificial present, which reminds me of our own traditions. Wouldn’t he be incapacitated if you performed such an act? If the occasion for your coming is to treat the princess Michal with this offering, Abishai, my favorite son, will perform the task since he is the one Michal, my first born, loves best ».

IKings reconsidered: I have often been struck by the importance of naming in the figure of the king of Israel, or even of the king of Judah in I and II Kings. David was called from tending sheep and Ammon was called to be king with Helaman residing in Jershon among the Ishmaelites in Helaman 8.


In David’s first speech to the elders who met with him about seeing the king’s face, he solved the epistemological problem of how to see no one at the time and communicate with the king’s staff when the king could speak only with the priest Abiathar as Niclot reported to him. David asked the elders:


»Who is it exactly that you want to ‘see the king’s face’ (?)? It doesn’t sound to me as if you are here to offer David the prince a sacrificial present, which reminds me of our own traditions. Wouldn’t he be incapacitated if you performed such an act?

We are thus made aware that the Thebans successfully and gloriously resisted and crushed the turbulent selfishness of the suitors, whereas the Greeks are doomed before even engaging with Hector.

So, from this first encounter of the two heroes onwards, we find constantly intimated how far superior Ajax is of mind, valour and fortune to the champion of the Greeks.

But Agamemnon still has to show the seamen the destined grave-mound of Achilles, the ransom of Hector’s body, and to apprise the Ionian women of their coming destiny.

anger of Athena against Ajax is not


CORRECTED TEXT:","anger of Athena against Ajax is not, strictly speaking, jealousy. She does not care (if she should happen to do so, I think she would be too honest to care) about the love which another goddess could receive from Ajax. Conversely, Ajax's boasted success and victory shed no enjoyment on Athena nor encourage any passion in her. No man was ever served by the cruel jealousies of the gods. Ajax will have smaller reasons to blame his loss of Athena on Athena, if he considers that the goddess did not love him and did not regard him more important than the victory he obtained. On the contrary, Ajax will be angry and will curse Athena if, after his victory over Hector, he believes that he will then sincerely honor Athena,","But the bearing of the prophet (genethlialogus) to Teucer, for whose sake he is sent, and the substance of his prophecy (hēbreto-sēma), assure the spectator that Ajax will be forgiven by Athena, and that there need be no despair of a happy issue to the war.

Are you not aware that the crisis of the drama is approaching? But this shows that the champion of the Greeks’ prejudices will be found to be less insulting towards Ajax at the end of the play.


Aiakos’ prophet, on the other hand, assures the sailors of their continued friendship with Priam’s son [Patroklos] in his master’s hour of need. So, from this first encounter of the two heroes onwards, we find constantly intimated how far superior Ajax is of mind, valour and fortune to the champion of the Greeks. Agamemnon has helped Menelaos gain freedom from bondage for his wife Helen for the sake of domestic affairs; Ajax has rid Achilles of utter disaster for love of country and single-handed combat. We must hasten to relate the adventures which followed.


Patroklos and Achilles, as we are made aware, are near. But Agamemnon still has to show the seamen the destined grave-mound of Achilles, the ransom of Hector’s body, and to apprise the Ionian women of their coming destiny. Ajax must go to Troy, to be surety for his captured friend, to be the guard of the body of Hector, to receive back the body of slain son[ilsos] and bear it to Achilles, to receive vengeance for his dead son[kios] whom Achilles will repay in all measure ... {103|}

CORRECTED TEXT:","To assist with the task, the characters in the table below stand for the OCR translator's guesses. Please enter the correct characters in each space provided, obeying the following conventions:


The OCR software exports every sequence of guessed characters plus a space as a single unit, which is a funny phenomenon typical of OCR software. In fact, the sentence to correct is this:


""Therefore it has been thrust forth before all men for their consideration and judgment and most of them agree that Peter certainly was at Rome. But seeing that false witnesses have criticized him in many ways they prove nothing concerning Peter's case [...]""

Persia IV involves editing a classical play written in Latin, Italian, Spanish, or French. The assignment will be to review the printed version of the script and annotate specific translation choices. Your job is to assume that the script is the translation of a play written originally in Ancient Greece or in Latin. In fact, the play is adapted from a play originally written in another language. Before writing your answers, please carefully read the entire segment ""QUESTIONS ON TRANSLATION TRANSFERENCE"".

Are you not aware that the crisis of the drama is approaching? But this shows that the champion of the Greeks’ prejudices will be found to be less insulting towards Ajax at the end of the play.

So, from this first encounter of the two heroes onwards, we find constantly intimated how far superior Ajax is of mind, valour and fortune to the champion of the Greeks. Agamemnon has helped Menelaos gain freedom from bondage for his wife Helen for the sake of domestic affairs; Ajax has rid Achilles of utter disaster for love of country and single-handed combat. We must hasten to relate the adventures which followed.

But Agamemnon still has to show the seamen the destined grave-mound of Achilles, the ransom of Hector’s body, and to apprise the Ionian women of their coming destiny. Ajax must go to Troy, to be surety for his captured friend, to be the guard of the body of Hector, to receive back the body of slain son[ilsos] and bear it to Achilles, to receive vengeance for his dead son[kios] whom Achilles will repay in all measure ... {103|}

Charon (disambiguation)
In Greek mythology, Charon or Kharon was a ferryman who transported the souls of the dead across the rivers Styx and Acheron that divided the upper world from the underworld. Some authors give his name as Erichthonius. Charon is the son of Erebus.

Discovering Corrupted Data and Defective Recordings:


Whereas standard assessment, whether of reading or content, seeks to locate the information in the student transcript or the automatic transcription, the tasks provided in this section and the previous two nudged students in the direction of analyzing and interrogating the text itself. Nancy Diane Hoffmann (1998) informs us that the recursive nature of the exercise let students consider the text in a new way; the necessary first step in discovering the extent to were erroneous or grossly compromised:","ἐκτὸς πημάτων. τὸ πρὶν ἴδοιμ' opã: πρὶν ἴδοιμ' ὀρθὸν ἔπος. 786. ἐκτὸς γὰρ ὑστερῆς μόρου οὔκ ἐν μεγάροις μᾶζαν ἀγαθὴν καὶ φυλακὴν ἄξιαν θυμῶν. 787. μέμψιν ὄμμασι τοὺς ἀτρύτας ὠκεῖος παρὰ τοὺς Θηβαίους ἀφανὴς

CORRECTED TEXT:","that of Ajax is a dream. The messenger says that Ajax wages war against strangers.
Did it really matter, Margarita asked herself, whether a machine interpreted dreams or whether man did?
The machine interpreted dreams; something was said to Krotov; he, poor man, listened with his ill-humoured, distracted look, the broken utterance of his state of scattered attention. She suddenly blushed at the thought that this might have been overheard, that it might have the ear of strangers and very likely provoke some impression of her youthful frivolousness.


Does it make a difference whether it (the something that happened) happened during our lifetimes or after our death? If God existed in eternity, is this important?.","In the Odyssey, Homer records the first instance of the expression, ""calling one's mother"":

THE METHOD

The method developed by Chaninat for scanning ancient texts and converting the results into text files was sophisticated for its time. However, even as a scanning system, it is not perfect: in many places, the positions for characters could not be determined exactly and the software simply inserted spaces between its best estimates.

In the original, the word is part of a medial sequence of three twelve-letter words. The final letter was misread as the third letter of the vowel before it. The Tironian symbol ' meant and (or sometimes hope). The author of the Classical commentary was Apuleius. Born in Madaurus, in Numidia, he lived under Septimius Severus.

The museum was built in 1932 to house the Agora Excavations of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and displays objects from the surrounding archaeological site, as well as from several smaller sites nearby. It remains the most popular attraction in the Agora Precinct.

Bearing in mind that the texts to be corrected have been written in a modern language (English, French, German or Italian), modern contemporary linguistic constructions should not be transcribed into ancient Greek or Latin. On the other hand, ancient word forms (which are not classical) may be used when they imitate ancient linguistic usage.

Please DO NOT edit the grammar or vocabulary of the full text of the document you are transcribing (except the section you have been asked to correct).

Because of the volume of the task, we will confine ourselves to replying to only one round of corrections. However, corrections to earlier rounds will be taken into account for future rounds.

To carry this hypothesis to its conclusion, supposing that each crime of the first generation continues to affect its quota of guilty blood even after the perpetrator's death, we wonder if not one but two groups of victims fell in the first animal sacrifice mentioned by Homer. We believe that the old men and heroes were corresponding to those sinners of the first generation, ancestors of which each guilt committed still generates corporeal punishment, either for the guilty ones themselves, or for their successors, under the present conditions (the expiation of guilt or the sacrificial rite). That would explain why the Anchises souls were willingly going back to Hades, while the old men were appearing deprived of reason and unconcerned by their animal victim","Corrige les erreurs invisibles automatiquement par transposé saisie des textes (OCR).

stands in the main line of ecclesial tradition, only that he
must be distinctly understood [=is misunderstood]; the only
thing that separates him, the only reason which still restrains
the theological extreme of universal Catholic Church hegemony

Henceforth the abbreviation “Cf.” will mean “compare with” instead of Cicero, Aristotle, etc. It should be noted that the Anchor Bible text-type for the HCSB Study Bible (OIPC iii-iv) differs from that of the Anchor Bible text-type for the HCSB (OIPC 5) insofar as the latter classifies otherwise Late Second Temple Hebrew books and Ecclesiastes as the moderately shorter IJSSc. This anomaly within JPSv3 is likely due to switching between Aramaic-English and Hebrew-English basic texts for the rendition of Ecclesiastes and I & 2 Chronicles. Both texts are registered in the OIPC 5 text-type as IHSSc.

EDIT THE TEXT:

In future editing, contribute however much you are able to improve the text. This will involve such changes as converting the writing into classical Greek or Latin, correcting the mistakes the classical commentarist made, making a new translation of the author's text where appropriate, and adding the missing words or phrases in the text. Due to the amount of work required for editing texts and the unavoidably rapid turnover of editors, do not use capital letters or punctuation marks, although arabic numerals are acceptable as are dashes preceding a footnote, in which case one dash and a space = an em-dash.","Πῶς γὰρ, ἥκοι ἢ καὶ ἀναφέρεται ἡ πρόβολος ἐν φελλα;

ECCLESIASTES, TRANSLATED AND EXEM - AOL Edited and introduced by David Winston INTRODUCTION 7. DavId Winston. Ecclesiastes / David Winston. Ecclesiastes, vol. 2 of The Hermeneia Commentahr’s. Ed. R. L. Hubbard, Jr. and David L. Petersen. (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1994), p. 239 (HCSB Study Bible). Hereafter abbreviated EC. Henceforth the abbreviation “Cf.” will mean “compare with” instead of Cicero, Aristotle, etc. It should be noted that the Anchor Bible text-type for the HCSB Study Bible (OIPC iii-iv) differs from that of the Anchor Bible text-type for the HCSB (OIPC 5) insofar as the latter classifies otherwise Late Second Temple Hebrew books and Ecclesiastes as the moderately shorter IJSSc. This anomaly within JPSv3 is likely due to switching between Aramaic-English and Hebrew-English basic texts for the rendition of Ecclesiastes and I & 2 Chronicles. Both texts are registered in the OIPC 5 text-type as IHSSc.

Your task is to carefully examine the following text and correct any mistakes introduced by the OCR software. The text to be corrected comes from a classical commentary; it is written mainly in a modern language (English, French, German or Italian) and can contain sequences of words in ancient languages (Ancient Greek and Latin). The text to be corrected appears after the segment ""TEXT TO CORRECT:"". Please place the corrected version of the text after the ""CORRECTED TEXT:"" segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.
