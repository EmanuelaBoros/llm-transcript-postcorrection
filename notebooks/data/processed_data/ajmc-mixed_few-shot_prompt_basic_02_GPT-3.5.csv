The short syllable in αἴθονος is sufficiently supported by ἄτοβα occurring in Hesychius in the right alphabetical order (immediately after ἄλος). Although αἴθοπος (see v. r1.) may be defended on the ground that the second part of a compound has sometimes little significance (see especially infr. 954, κελαινῶπαν θυμόν), αἴθων, which directly expresses character, is more appropriate here and has the preponderance of MS. authority in its favour. 

222. ἄτλατον οὐδὲ φευκτάν: ‘That cannot be avoided or endured.’ 

225. μεγάλων: ‘Terrible.’ The mariners, in their feebleness (supr. 165 foll.), are afraid of the opinion of the host. These words are added as a comment on οὐδὲ φευκτάν. The consequences of the fact cannot be eluded, since it is known to the host and magnified by rumor.

Correct the spelling and grammar of the following text: 2786 Instead of ketvos, we might have looked for atr6s: but the former has been preferred, because it better marks the antithesis between Ajax and his friends.

275 Instead of κεῖνος, we might have looked for αὐτός : but the former has been preferred, because it better marks the antithesis between Ajax and his friends.

Correct the spelling and grammar of the following text: —Note the light touch with which the poet accounts for the absence of Teucer—a necessity of the plets since Teucer might have averted his rother’s suicide.

—Note the light touch with which the poet accounts for the absence of Teucer—a necessity of the plot, since Teucer might have averted his brotherʼs suicide.

Correct the spelling and grammar of the following text: Verbum κατηναρισμένας ex h.","Producit Suidas σ. Λείας. Verbum κατηναρισμένας ex h. l.""

Corrected: Suidas mentions Λείας. The word κατηναρισμένας is from this passage.","Verbum κατηναρισμένας ex h. 

The text is incomplete and there are no spelling or grammar errors, but it appears to be Latin. The translation of the text would be ""The word κατηναρισμένας from this"".",". 245, we may read here οἵαν ἐδήλωσας καρ αἴθονος. The short syllable in αἴθονος is sufficiently supported by ἄτοβα occurring in Hesychius in the right alphabetical order (immediately after ἄλος). Although αἴθοπος (see v. r1.) may be defended on the ground that the second part of a compound has sometimes little significance (see especially infr. 954, κελαινῶπαν θυμόν), αἴθων, which directly expresses character, is more appropriate here and has the preponderance of MS. authority in its favour. 

222. ἄτλατον οὐδὲ φευκτάν: ‘That cannot be avoided or endured.’ 

225. μεγάλων: ‘Terrible.’ The mariners, in their feebleness (supr. 165 foll.), are afraid of the opinion of the host. These words are added as a comment on οὐδὲ φευκτάν. The consequences of the fact cannot be eluded, since it is known to the host and magnified by rumor.

Corrected: Suidas mentions Λείας. The word κατηναρισμένας is from this passage.","Verbum κατηναρισμένας ex h. 

The text is incomplete and there are no spelling or grammar errors, but it appears to be Latin. The translation of the text would be ""The word κατηναρισμένας from this"".",". 245, we may read here οἵαν ἐδήλωσας καρ αἴθονος. The short syllable in αἴθονος is sufficiently supported by ἄτοβα occurring in Hesychius in the right alphabetical order (immediately after ἄλος). Although αἴθοπος (see v. r1.) may be defended on the ground that the second part of a compound has sometimes little significance (see especially infr. 954, κελαινῶπαν θυμόν), αἴθων, which directly expresses character, is more appropriate here and has the preponderance of MS. authority in its favour. 

222. ἄτλατον οὐδὲ φευκτάν: ‘That cannot be avoided or endured.’ 

225. μεγάλων: ‘Terrible.’ The mariners, in their feebleness (supr. 165 foll.), are afraid of the opinion of the host. These words are added as a comment on οὐδὲ φευκτάν. The consequences of the fact cannot be eluded, since it is known to the host and magnified by rumor.

The short syllable in αἴθονος is sufficiently supported by ἄτοβα occurring in Hesychius in the right alphabetical order (immediately after ἄλος). Although αἴθοπος (see v. r1.) may be defended on the ground that the second part of a compound has sometimes little significance (see especially infr. 954, κελαινῶπαν θυμόν), αἴθων, which directly expresses character, is more appropriate here and has the preponderance of MS. authority in its favour. 

222. ἄτλατον οὐδὲ φευκτάν: ‘That cannot be avoided or endured.’ 

225. μεγάλων: ‘Terrible.’ The mariners, in their feebleness (supr. 165 foll.), are afraid of the opinion of the host. These words are added as a comment on οὐδὲ φευκτάν. The consequences of the fact cannot be eluded, since it is known to the host and magnified by rumor.

Ajax, whose mother was Eriboea (569). —τὸν εἰσαεὶ .. χρόνον : the phrase τὸν ἀεὶ χρόνον is frequent. The separation of τὸν εἰσαεὶ from χρόνον deserves notice, as suggesting the possibility hat τὸν ἀεἰ may sometimes have been used (without χρό- νον) as = 'for ever ʼ: a usage which, how- ever, lacks proof: see on El. 1075.— λεηλατήσει: he had gone to the uplands of Mysia (720), 'in pursuit of foesʼ (564) to be despoiled. Cp. Thuc. I. II § 1 (the Greeks at Troy) φαίνονται...πρὸς γεωργίαν τῆς Χερσονήσου τραπόμενοι καὶ λῃστείαν τῆς τροφῆς ἀπορίᾳ. The Iliad glances at such predatory expeditions (e.g. I. 366; 9. 328).—Note the light touch with which the poet accounts for the absence of Teucer—a necessity of the plot, since Teucer might have averted his brotherʼs suicide. 344 . ἀνοίγετε: a usual form of summons, addressed to no particular per- son, but to the inmates of the house generally; Aesch.

Ajax had πρόσπολοι, though they were not at this time in the house (539).—We should not explain the plur. as addressed by the choregus to the choreutae and Tecmessa.
