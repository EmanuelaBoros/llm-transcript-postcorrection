They were not contented with this trial of their skill, went further in their conjurations, and raised up two spirits, each of them one. Bungye charged his spirit to assist him with the greatest power he had, that by it he might be able to overcome Vandermast. The Devil told him he would if he would give him just three drops of blood from his left arm, but if he did deny him that, then Vandermast would have power over him to do what he wished. The same was told to Vandermast's Devil. With this demand of the spirits, they both agreed, thinking they would overcome each other, but the Devil overthrew them both. They having given the Devil this blood, as spoken before, they both fell again to their conjurations. First, Bungye raised Achilles with his Greeks, who marched about Vandermast and threatened him. Then Vandermast raised Hector with his Trojans, who defended him from Achilles and the Greeks. Then began a great battle between the Greeks and Trojans, which continued for a good space.

To this demand of the spirits, they both agreed, thinking to overcome each other, but the devil overthrew them both.

Vandermast, following his example, raised up Perseus, who also fought with his sea-monster and killed it, so they were both released from their danger. They, being not content with this trial of their skill, went further in their conjurations and raised up two spirits, each of them one. Bungye charged his spirit to assist him with the greatest power he had so that by it he might be able to overcome Vandermast. The Devil told him he would if he would give him but three drops of blood from his left arm, but if he denied him that, then Vandermast would have power over him to do what he would. The like was told to Vandermast's Devil, to which demand of the spirits they both agreed, thinking they would overcome each other, but the Devil overthrew them both. They, having given the Devil this blood as is before spoken of, they both fell again to their conjurations. First, Bungye raised Achilles with his Greeks, who marched about Vandermast and threatened him. Then Vandermast raised Hector with his Trojans, who defended him from Achilles and the Greeks. Then began a great battle between the Greeks and Trojans, which continued for a good space; at last, Hector was slain, and the Trojans fled. A great tempest followed, with thunder and lightning, so that the two conjurers wished that they had been away.

Vandermast, following his example, raised up Perseus, who also fought with his sea-monster and killed it, so both were released from their danger. They, not being contented with this trial of their skill, went further in their conjurations and raised up two spirits, each of them one. Bungye charged his spirit to assist him with the greatest power he had, so that he might be able to overcome Vandermast. The Devil told him he would if he would give him just three drops of blood from his left arm; but if he denied him that, then Vandermast would have power over him to do what he wanted. The same was told by Vandermast's Devil to him. To this demand of the spirits, they both agreed, thinking they would overcome each other, but the Devil overthrew them both. Having given the Devil this blood, as mentioned before, they both fell again to their conjurations. First, Bungye raised Achilles with his Greeks, who marched around Vandermast and threatened him. Then Vandermast raised Hector with his Trojans, who defended him from Achilles and the Greeks. A great battle then ensued between the Greeks and Trojans, which continued for a good while.

Voilà ce que je vois. -J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. -Votre camarade ? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous ! -Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dût-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie. Tâchez d'en venir à bout et j'incli-nerai ma science devant la vôtre. L'aimez-vous ? - Si je l'aime 1 Vous me demandez si je l'aime! Ne le voyez-vous pas ? - Eh bien 1 alors, il y a quelque chance pour que vous réussissiez. Mais, ou je me trompe fort, ou ce sera une cure difficile.

Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas.

Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas.

Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons? La chose en valait-elle la peine? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice; probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif?

Il faut si peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux, on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, on puise des motifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis, la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul, mais une force impérieuse et presque indépendante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons? La chose en valait-elle la peine? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice; probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif?

Correct the text: 290 CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. XXXV Cette crise fut plus longue que ceile qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès. Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement.

Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement.

George, who fought with the dragon, and killed it. Vandermast, following his example, raised up Perseus, who also fought with his sea-monster and killed it, so they were both released from their danger. They, not being content with this trial of their skill, went further in their conjurations, and raised up two spirits, one for each of them. Bungye charged his spirit to assist him with the greatest power he had, so that by it he might be able to overcome Vandermast. The Devil told him he would, if he would give him but three drops of blood from his left arm; but if he denied him that, then Vandermast would have power over him to do what he would. The same was told by Vandermast's Devil to him. To this demand of the spirits, they both agreed, thinking they would overcome each other, but the Devil overthrew them both. Having given the Devil this blood, as spoken of before, they both fell again to their conjurations. First, Bungye raised Achilles with his Greeks, who marched about Vandermast and threatened him. Then Vandermast raised Hector with his Trojans, who defended him from Achilles and the Greeks. A great battle between the Greeks and Trojans then began, which continued for a good space. At last, Hector was slain and the Trojans fled. Then there followed a great tempest, with thunder and lightning, so that the two conjurers wished they had been away.

They all entreated him to spare the books, because in them there were those things that after-ages might receive great benefit by.

And these are the names of the devils.

And when Friar Rush saw that they were fighting together, he quickly blew out all the candles and lamps that were burning in the church, and left no manner of light therein whereby one might see the other. When he had so done, he took his truncheon in his hand and went into the choir among the thickest of the friars, who were fighting fiercely without light. He laid so lustily about that many of them he felled to the ground and left them there for dead.
