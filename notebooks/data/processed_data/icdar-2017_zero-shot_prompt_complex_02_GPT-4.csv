CORRECTED TEXT:","His time he spent in prayer, meditation, and such divine exercises, and did seek by","OF FRYER BACON. 249 my studies have found the secrets of the stars. The books that I have made of them serve for presidents to our greatest doctors, so excellent has my judgment been therein. I likewise have found out the secrets of trees, plants, and stones, with their several uses, yet all this knowledge of mine I esteem so lightly, that I wish that I were ignorant, and knew nothing, for the knowledge of these things, as I have truly found, serves not to better a man in goodness, but only to make him proud and think too well of himself. What has all my knowledge of nature's secrets gained me? Only this, the loss of a better knowledge, the loss of divine studies, which makes the immortal part of man, his soul, blessed. I have found that my knowledge has been a heavy burden and has kept down my good thoughts, but I will remove the cause, which are these books, which I do purpose here before you all to burn. They all entreated him to spare the books, because in them there were those things that after-ages might receive great benefit by. He would not hearken unto them but threw them all into the fire, and in that flame burnt the greatest learning in the world. Then did he dispose of all his goods; some part he gave to poor scholars, and some he gave to other poor folks. Nothing left he for himself; then, he caused to be made in the church-wall a cell, where he locked himself in, and there remained until his death.

When his dame saw that he had so soon ended his business, she thought that he was a profitable servant, and said little but let him alone. In the evening Rush demanded of his master what he should do the next morrow? His master appointed him twice so much as he did the day before, which Rush refused not, but got up early in the morning, and went to the field, and about his work. So soon as his master was ready, he took his man's breakfast and came to the field, thinking to help Rush but he was no sooner come from his house but the Priest came to see his wife, and presently she made ready some good meat for them to be merry withal, and while it was dressing, they sat sporting together, who had been there should have seen many loving touches. And when the goodman came to the field, he found that Rush had done all that which he appointed, whereof he had great marvel. Then they sat down to breakfast, and as they sat together, Rush beheld his master's shoes, and perceived that for fault of greasing they were very hard. Then said Rush to his master, why are not your shoes better greased? I marvel that you can go in them, they be so hard, have you no more at home? Yes, said his master, I have another pair lying under a great chest at home in my chamber.

CORRECTED TEXT:","He answered, of","226 THE FAMOUS HISTORY did foresee, was caused by the German conjurer Van dermast, for he vowed a revenge for the disgrace that he had received. To execute the same, he hired a Walloon soldier, and gave him one hundred crowns to do the same, fifty beforehand, and fifty when he had killed him. Friar Bacon, to save himself from this danger that was likely to happen to him, would always when he read, hold a ball of brass in his hand, and under that ball would he set a basin of brass, that if he did chance to sleep in his reading, the fall of the ball out of his hand into the basin might wake him. Being one day in his study in this manner, and asleep, the Walloon soldier had got in to him, and had drawn his sword to kill him but as he was ready to strike, down fell the ball out of Friar Bacon's hand, and woke him. He, seeing the soldier stand there with a drawn sword, asked him what he was, and wherefore he came there in that manner? The soldier boldly answered him thus: ""I am a Walloon, and a soldier, and more than this, a villain. I am come hither because I was sent. I was sent because I was hired. I was hired because I dared to do it. The thing I should do is not done. The thing to be done is to kill thee. Thus have you heard what I am and why I came.""
