Nous nous étions abordés en ennemis, nous allions nous quitter les meilleurs amis du monde. Non pas qu'il y eût là-dedans quelque chose de sérieux ni de dangereux pour vous, mais ce bon vivant avait jeté sur notre intérieur un peu de vie et de mouvement. Il avait fait rire ma grand-mère, l'avait tenue éveillée sans effort et heureuse de cette distraction. Je lui savais gré de cela, et en retour, j'oubliai complètement les petits ennuis qu'il m'avait autrefois causés, ses impertinences, ses airs évaporés, ses pipes, ses cravates et sa barbe. Il gagnait à être vu de près et y reprenait tous ses avantages. De toute la soirée, il ne lui échappa rien qui pût blesser mes oreilles ni contrarier la révolution qui s'opérait en moi. Il se contint, il s'observa d'une manière parfaite jusqu'au moment où il nous quitta. J'étais loin de m'attendre à la surprise qu'il me ménageait. Il s'était levé et avait salué la grand-mère, qui lui avait tendu la main très-affectueusement. De mon côté, j'avais pris le flambeau pour le reconduire. Il était tard, les étages supérieurs étaient déjà dans les ténèbres, et à moins de l'exposer à une chute, il me fallait le raccompagner le long des degrés. Lui pourtant se confondait en excuses et me suppliait à chaque marche de ne pas aller plus loin. Enfin, je cédai et me disposai à l'abandonner. Déjà, les derniers mots étaient échangés et j'allais remonter l'escalier quand mon flambeau s'éteignit tout à coup. Était-ce lui ? Était-ce le vent ? Je ne l'ai jamais su, mais, au moment où l'obscurité se fit, je me sentis saisie par la taille et, sans que je pusse m'en défendre, embrassée sur les deux joues avec une ardeur qui me couvrit de confusion. Je poussai un cri, déjà l'audacieux avait disparu. Rentrée au logis, je rallumai le flambeau, de façon à ce que la grand-mère ne pût se douter de rien ni m'adresser de questions embarrassantes. Déjà le mystère commençait. Déjà, entre Melchior et moi, s'ourdissait une sorte de complicité. J'étais outrée de ce qu'il venait de se permettre, je me promettais bien de ne pas m'y exposer de nouveau et de faire preuve de fermeté à l'avenir. Mais en même temps, je ne pouvais m'empêcher de ressentir une étrange excitation, une sorte d'attrait pour cet homme qui, malgré ses défauts, avait su me séduire.

CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE.

Personne n'y avait songé. Melchior avait ce don, il s'emparait des gens et ne lâchait prise que lorsque cela lui convenait. Ce fut de lui-même qu'il prit congé. Nous nous étions abordés en ennemis, nous allions nous quitter les meilleurs amis du monde. Non pas qu'il y eût là-dedans quelque chose de sérieux ni de dangereux pour vous, mais ce bon vivant avait jeté sur notre intérieur un peu de vie et de mouvement. Il avait fait rire ma grand-mère, l'avait tenue éveillée sans effort et heureuse de cette distraction. Je lui savais gré de cela, et en retour, j'oubliai complètement les petits ennuis qu'il m'avait autrefois causés, ses impertinences, ses airs évaporés, ses pipes, ses cravates et sa barbe. Il gagnait à être vu de près et y reprenait tous ses avantages. De toute la soirée, il ne lui échappa rien qui pût blesser mes oreilles ni contrarier la révolution qui s'opérait en moi. Il se contint, il s'observa d'une manière parfaite jusqu'au moment où il nous quitta. J'étais loin de m'attendre à la surprise qu'il me ménageait. Il s'était levé et avait salué la grand-mère, qui lui avait tendu la main très-affectueusement. De mon côté, j'avais pris le flambeau pour le reconduire. Il était tard, les étages supérieurs étaient déjà dans les ténèbres, et à moins de l'exposer à une chute, il me fallait le raccompagner le long des degrés. Lui pourtant se confondait en excuses et me suppliait à chaque marche de ne pas aller plus loin. Enfin, je cédai et me disposai à l'abandonner. Déjà, les derniers mots étaient échangés et j'allais remonter l'escalier quand mon flambeau s'éteignit tout à coup. Était-ce lui ? Était-ce le vent ? Je ne l'ai jamais su, mais, au moment où l'obscurité se fit, je me sentis saisie par la taille et, sans que je pusse m'en défendre, embrassée sur les deux joues avec une ardeur qui me couvrit de confusion. Je poussai un cri, déjà l'audacieux avait disparu. Rentrée au logis, je rallumai le flambeau, de façon à ce que la grand-mère ne pût se douter de rien ni m'adresser de questions embarrassantes. Déjà le mystère commençait. Déjà, entre Melchior et moi, s'ourdissait une sorte de complicité. J'étais outrée de ce qu'il venait de se permettre, je me promettais bien de ne pas m'y exposer de nouveau et de faire preuve de fermeté à l'avenir.

CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE.

Personne n'y avait songé. Melchior avait ce don, il s'emparait des gens et ne lâchait prise que lorsque cela lui convenait. Ce fut de lui-même qu'il prit congé. Nous nous étions abordés en ennemis, nous allions nous quitter les meilleurs amis du monde. Non pas qu'il y eût là-dedans quelque chose de sérieux ni de dangereux pour vous, mais ce bon vivant avait jeté sur notre intérieur un peu de vie et de mouvement. Il avait fait rire ma grand-mère, l'avait tenue éveillée sans effort et heureuse de cette distraction. Je lui savais gré de cela, et en retour, j'oubliai complètement les petits ennuis qu'il m'avait autrefois causés, ses impertinences, ses airs évaporés, ses pipes, ses cravates et sa barbe. Il gagnait à être vu de près et y reprenait tous ses avantages. De toute la soirée, il ne lui échappa rien qui pût blesser mes oreilles ni contrarier la révolution qui s'opérait en moi. Il se contint, il s'observa d'une manière parfaite jusqu'au moment où il nous quitta. J'étais loin de m'attendre à la surprise qu'il me ménageait. Il s'était levé et avait salué la grand-mère, qui lui avait tendu la main très-affectueusement. De mon côté, j'avais pris le flambeau pour le reconduire.

Rush then took some truncheons and sharpened them like swords, and gave them to the Friers, telling them to use them against each other.

Rush then pretended to be shocked by what had happened and claimed to have no idea how the truncheons had gotten into the hands of the Friers. Rush was scolded by the Priour, and he acted as though he was sorry.

Il faut si. peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui ! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, -on puise des mo-tifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant- de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul mais une force impérieuse et presque indépen-dante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons? La chose en valait-elle la peine? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus.

CE PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. 257 j'obéis, tant il y avait en moi de confusion et de trouble. Il faut si peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui ! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, on puise des mo-tifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul mais une force impérieuse et presque indépen-dante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons ? La chose en valait-elle la peine ? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ?

Fryer Bacon witnessed a quarrel between two young men, one claiming that his father had been wronged by the other. The argument turned violent and both men stabbed each other to death. Fryer Bacon blamed himself, believing that the magical glass he had created was the cause of their deaths. He regretted his pursuit of knowledge and wished he had spent his time on holy pursuits. He destroyed the glass and mourned the deaths of the two young men, as well as the deaths of Vandermast and Fryer Bungey. He was so grief-stricken that he refused to eat for three days and kept to his chamber.",GPT-3.5,prompt_basic_02,prompt_basic_02,few-shot,results-3few-shot-icdar-2017-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl,1277,1.0,0.7476635514018691,-0.25233644859813087,99-100%,0.969159599074788,0.2960062646828504,-0.6945742837759292,80-99%,-0.47345536618703005,Negative Improvement

Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. -Non, lui dit-il, restez. -Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? -Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Votre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une autre, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. -J'obéis alors. -Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie. Tâchez d'en venir à bout et j'incli-nerai ma science devant la vôtre. L'aimez-vous ? -Si je l'aime ! Vous me demandez si je l'aime ! Ne le voyez-vous pas ? -Eh bien ! alors, il y a quelque chance pour que vous réussissiez. Mais, ou je me trompe fort, ou ce sera une cure difficile. Cet entretien avait lieu à voix si basse, que rien n'en pou-vait parvenir aux oreilles de Marguerite, et, pourtant, il se fit chez elle un mouvement singulier. Sa main, raidie et con-ractée, se replia d'elle-même et vint se poser sur sa poi-

Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solùment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit. On sait à quel homme il avait af-faire, c'était un casuiste en matière d'attributions il s'élança à la poursuite de l'intrus. - Monsieurl s'écria-t-il, Monsieur! Ludovic était déjà loin. Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. - Où allez-vous, Monsieur? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait ehez qui ils allaient. - Où je vais? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. - Comment, je le vois? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication. Voilà ce que je vois. - J'accompagne mon camarade, dit le docteur en essayant de s'ouvrir un chemin laissez-moi passer. - Votre camarade? Il est aussi peu gêné que vous 1 - Voyons, finissons-en. La querelle s'échauffait, et l'austère concierge était bien décidé à faire respecter ses consignes, dtlt-il compromettre l'intégrité de ses membres. Il avait pris la rampe à deux mains et s'arc-boutait de manière à ce qu'il ne restât point d'espace libre sur les degrés. A moins de violence, le pas-sage était infranchissable, et le docteur n'osait pas pousser les choses si loin. Heureusement Ludovic se ravisa sans lui, l'affaire ne pouvait pas s'arranger il prit le parti de des-cendre.

Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons ? La chose en valait-elle la peine ? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif ? Voilà à quelles impressions je cédai sans m'en rendre bien compte, ni pénétrer trop avant dans mon coeur Peut-être, hélas ! en interrogeant mieux ce coeur, aurais-je trouvé le dernier mot de ces réticences. La suite ne l'a que trop prouvé j'étais déjà touchée, j'entrais dans cette série de faiblesses qui m'ont perdue. C'est ici que j'ai besoin de votre pardon, Ludovic, d'un pardon absolu et généreux. Point d'excuse possible, rien qui puisse pallier ce commen-cement de trahison. Vous aviez été pour moi le meilleur, le plus dévoué et le plus fidèle des amis vous n'aviez qu'une pensée, mon bonheur qu'un but, notre union. Jamais, c'est une justice que je me plais à vous rendre, aucun chagrin ne m'est venu de vous si j'exprimais un désir, vous vous em-pressiez de le satisfaire si j'avais un ennui, vous vous offriez à le partager. Vous étiez de ces loyaux compagnons qu'une femme est trop heureuse de rencontrer dans sa vie, qui l'as-sistent dans les bons et les mauvais jours et se donnent sans réserve comme sans calcul. Je voyais tout cela, je le sentais et ne méconnaissais point vos mérites. Lui, au contraire, qu'était-il et quel fonds

Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie.

XXXV Cette crise fut plus longue que ceile qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès. Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie.

290 CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. XXXV Cette crise fut plus longue que cede qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès. Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte.

Ne le voyez-vous pas ? -Eh bien ! alors, il y a quelque chance pour que vous réussissiez. Mais, ou je me trompe fort, ou ce sera une cure difficile.

Il faut si. peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui ! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, -on puise des mo-tifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant- de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul mais une force impérieuse et presque indépen-dante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons? La chose en valait-elle la peine? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ?

CE PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. 257 j'obéis, tant il y avait en moi de confusion et de trouble. Il faut si peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui ! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, on puise des mo-tifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul mais une force impérieuse et presque indépen-dante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons ? La chose en valait-elle la peine ? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif ?

Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer.

278 CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. -Plus vite, ce serait difficile nous marchons à en perdre la respiration. -Avez-vous au moins tout ce qu'il vous faut en cas d'é-vénement ? -Soyez tranquille. -Des antidotes surtout ? -Ne vous en préoccupez pas j'y ai songé d'ailleurs c'est de règle aujourd'hui. Tout médecin a sur lui sa petite pharmacie. Ils touchaient à la porte de Marguerite. Ludovic passa ré-solûment et enjamba les degrés sans même jeter un nom au concierge. Mal lui en prit.

Mais le docteur y avait mis moins de zèle, et ce fut sur lui que le concierge se rabattit. -Où allez-vous, Monsieur ? lui dit-il en lui barrant le pas-sage. Le docteur eût été embarrassé de le dire. Il avait suivi son ami et ignorait chez qui ils allaient. -Où je vais ? dit-il avec un peu d'impatience mais vous le voyez bien. -Comment, je le vois ? mais je vois que vous tombez sur mon escalier comme une bombe sans me dire seulement gare, ni me fournir un mot d'explication.

XXXV Cette crise fut plus longue que ceile qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès. Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Vôtre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une auire, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez. - J'obéis alors. - Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au coeur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas c'est le dégoût de la vie.

Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà pro-fondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas.

- Oui, planqués en première ligne comme vous autres, répondit Régnier avec colère, et il continua à poser des questions. - Le poste téléphonique ?

Soudain, une tête surgit d'un trou et un bras lui fit signe d'approcher.

- C'est nous, fit Régnier, où est le poste ?
- Il n'y en a pas, répondit une voix, on est entassés dans un abri !

Couché presque à plat ventre, Régnier se glissa dans l'excavation.

Accroupi, replié sur lui-même, il parvint tant bien que mal à établir sa communication.

- Dites donc, vous n'êtes pas là pour faire la causette, fit brusquement un adjudant, fermez ça une fois pour toutes.

Le mieux pour lui était de se taire, car il sentait une atmosphère hostile. Les deux soldats qui partaient mirent leurs sacs sur le dos, se quittèrent en se serrant la main et s'éloignèrent rapidement.

Et sans se décourager, il continua en s'adressant à des soldats qui tiraillaient quelques cartouches.

- C'est les téléphonistes.
- Ah, les planqués ! chuchotèrent les hommes.
- Oui, planqués en première ligne comme vous autres, répondit Régnier avec colère, et il continua à poser des questions. - Le poste téléphonique ?
- Taisez-vous, souffla un sergent, nous sommes à vingt mètres des Boches !

Soudain, une tête surgit d'un trou et un bras lui fit signe d'approcher.

- C'est nous, fit Régnier, où est le poste ?
- Il n'y en a pas, répondit une voix, on est entassés dans un abri !

Couché presque à plat ventre, Régnier se glissa dans l'excavation.
