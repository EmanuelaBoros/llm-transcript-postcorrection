Une rue du parc du monde

La rue de Cagliarne est une rue que nous connaissons dans le développement de l'entreprise TEXTE (TEXTE.com), donc dans le secteur écologique et de la culture d'un pays qui s'en réunirait.

La rue est toute l'histoire du palais de commerce et du monde.

And his son-in-law and his son-in-law and his brother were in the house, where they saw and heard, that the King of Scots had slain the son of the boy.

The king and his people were very angry, and said they did not know the reasons for their being so, and that they did not know of any man, not a man at all, who could bring a brother of the queen to life. They said this was for his own safety, and therefore they did not like Fryer Bacon, who was also the dearer of them all, because he had brought their death to the court of the king. The king was so angry at this that he said, they will not fear me that I may do as well to you all as Fryer Bacon. The King said, the dearer of you all, and Fryer Bacon, and I thought they were men of honour, because they were the two most faithful and the most true of them all. He said to the king, you have caused me to have an opinion that you are all men of honour, but I think you were not. The king said, Fryer Bacon, and I thought you were men of honour because you did not kill him as much as you should, and I did not care to kill you as much as I should, for fear that my life would be lost in order that you might be made king of all the nations, but I would rather have you die a little, than a little, because of you. So Fryer Bacon said to the king, I will die and make you king, and I have but half of what you gave me. Then they both stood there and said, do not kill him and your brothers. Fryer Bacon said to the king, but you did not have to kill him as much as you should have, for I could kill him if I wanted to, or I would kill him if he tried to, and I knew not what to say to you, and I thought you would not kill him, since I knew you would not be happy with me and that I should live",OPT-350M,prompt_complex_lang,prompt_complex_03_per_lang,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-350m.jsonl,1520,0.9173789173789174,0.2783661119515885,-0.6965636481521504,80-99%,0.9658725048293625,0.310740354535975,-0.6782801529370873,80-99%,-0.6874219005446189,Negative Improvement

*","OF FRYER BACON. 221 THE HEIR of our father, Fryer Bacon the King of Holland, with many others, were the first to come to the court, for hee had been made the dearer of them all, and the king had not been pleased with their being so, but thought to make him the dearer of them all and made Fryer Bacon the king's dearer. The king and his people were very angry, and said they did not know the reasons for their being so, and that they did not know of any man, not a man at all, who could bring a brother of the queen to life. They said this was for his own safety, and therefore they did not like Fryer Bacon, who was also the dearer of them all, because he had brought their death to the court of the king. The king was so angry at this that he said, they will not fear me that I may do as well to you all as Fryer Bacon. The King said, the dearer of you all, and Fryer Bacon, and I thought they were men of honour, because they were the two most faithful and the most true of them all. He said to the king, you have caused me to have an opinion that you are all men of honour, but I think you were not. The king said, Fryer Bacon, and I thought you were men of honour because you did not kill him as much as you should, and I did not care to kill you as much as I should, for fear that my life would be lost in order that you might be made king of all the nations, but I would rather have you die a little, than a little, because of you. So Fryer Bacon said to the king, I will die and make you king, and I have but half of what you gave me. Then they both stood there and said, do not kill him and your brothers. Fryer Bacon said to the king, but you did not have to kill him as much as you should have, for I could kill him if I wanted to, or I would kill him if he tried to, and I knew not what to say to you, and I thought you would not kill him, since I knew you would not be happy with me and that I should live",OPT-350M,prompt_complex_lang,prompt_complex_03_per_lang,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-350m.jsonl,1520,1.0,0.09172259507829977,-0.9082774049217002,99-100%,0.9658725048293625,0.310740354535975,-0.6782801529370873,80-99%,-0.7932787789293938,Negative Improvement

CORRECTED TEXT:","Coronary heart disease, or heart failure.


In the case of heart failure, a heart failure occurs when the heart beats too quickly without a adequate supply of blood to the blood vessels. The heart becomes weaker and stops beating. It also causes the heart to be deflated or contracted or to fail to produce enough oxygen to the blood vessels. A heart failure can be diagnosed and treated by doing a series of tests to check for the cause.

A test for heart failure includes two tests:

The heart attack or heart failure test","'For aught is sure, that when he did that, he should have been made guilty, for the death of one of the two gentlemen was so very bad, that there would have been no man in the land, who could do good, but if his blood had not been there, he would have died as if he had not killed him.'

Correspondents in this letter: ""The two gentlemen, though in so terrible and terrible a state, and so poor and miserable, had by this time all their minds in a frenzy, that they could not take a step that could be so unjust, but that the most grievous and horrible and horrible thing had occurred. The blood of the two men was aske on the other's arm; the blood of Fryer Bacon, for that he had been slain, had been upon his own hand. The whole world would have been in a frenzy had these two died so many days. It was a ghastly sight to behold. The blood that was about them, had been drawn to them, and they had had so much that they had not been able to put away it all. Now the blood was to be taken away, as well as the blood that was around them, had been drawn to them, and they had not had it all in their arms. The blood had been poured out of them, as it was supposed, by the two men. The blood that was in them, was put away by the two men, and they were alive again. In two days the two men were dead; they were all very much alive, and the blood of Fryer Bacon was still in their hands. The blood of Fryer Bacon did not do them any good. Their hearts were now all broken. The blood of Fryer Bacon was too deep, and the blood of Vandermast was too deep in the blood of Fryer Bacon, that the blood of Vandermast was not to be removed.

It will take away our breath;

Its hands will take away our breath.

The whole world would have been in a frenzy had these two died so many days. It was a ghastly sight to behold. The blood that was about them, had been drawn to them, and they had had so much that they had not been able to put away it all. Now the blood was to be taken away, as well as the blood that was around them, had been drawn to them, and they had not had it all in their arms. The blood had been poured out of them, as it was supposed, by the two men. The blood that was in them, was put away by the two men, and they were alive again. In two days the two men were dead; they were all very much alive, and the blood of Fryer Bacon was still in their hands. The blood of Fryer Bacon did not do them any good. Their hearts were now all broken. The blood of Fryer Bacon was too deep, and the blood of Vandermast was too deep in the blood of Fryer Bacon, that the blood of Vandermast was not to be removed.

Par le concours des circonstances, j'étais compromise à un point qu'aucune réparation n'était possible, si ce n'est celle que pouvait m'offrir Melchior. Son but était atteint il m'avait mise à la discrétion de son hon-neur. Triste garantie ! et je le vis bien plus tard. Je succombai une barrière s'éleva entre vous et moi je ne pouvais plus être à vous, Ludovic. Les heures s'écou-laient il fallut prendre un parti. Encore quelques instants, et vous alliez venir chercher votre fiancée impossible de vous attendre en vous voyant je serais tombée morte à vos pieds. Nous prîmes donc, Melchior et moi, nos dernières dis-positions. Au petit jour, et quand la porte fut ouverte, il quitta la maison. Un rendez-vous avait été fixé, et je devais aller le rejoindre. Il passa sans être aperçu peut-être le concierge était-il son complice. Quant à moi, je restai pendant une heure encore abîmée dans mes regrets et mes remords. Toutes vos bontés me revinrent alors à la mémoire, et je me trouvai bien ingrate, bien cruelle et en même temps bien déchue. Qu'alliez-vous penser de moi ? Hélas ! quoi que vous pussiez en penser, la réalité dépasserait vos suppositions. J'étais une fille déshonorée !

Puis j'enlevai de mon doigt l'anneau qui me venait de ma grand'mère et qui avait si mal préservé mon honneur. Je n'étais plus digne de le porter, quoi qu'il arrivât et de quel-que façon que tournassent les choses. Je rejoignis Melchior et le trouvai ivre de son bonheur. Moi-même, à ce premier moment, j'éprouvai ce vertige des sens qui n'est que la fausse monnaie de l'amour.

And when Frier Rush saw that they were fighting together, anon he blew out all the candles and lamps that were burning in the church, and left no manner of fight therein whereby the one might see the other and when he had so done, he tooke his truncheon in his hand, and went into the Quier among the thickest of the Friers the which were fighting freshly without light, and there he laid so lustily about, that many of them he felled to the ground, and left them there for dead, and when he had so done, he stole his way from them, and as hee went, he found standing in the portall of the Quier, a great olde deske, and anon hee tooke the deske betweene both his hands, and threw it over the portall into the Quier among all the Friers, and hurt many sore, in so much that some had an arme broken, and some a legge, and other some had their noses, cleane pared from their faces, that the bloud ranne in their mouthes, and as for broken heads to the hard scalpe were no dainty, for every man had one, there scaped none free away, who had been there, should have had a goodly pastime to see the Friers creepe about the Quier, and in steede of Domine labia they cried out alas and well away.


CORRECTED TEXT:","And it was that Frier Rush went out of his way to get rid of the friers which he saw on the quier and who was also on the Quier, and when he had done he went to the Quier among all the Friers, and there he found a great many of them dead, and there came the little frier who were in his quier, and when he had so done, he threw himself before him with a great crowd of them, and said that the quier was but a small body of a people who had come out of the quier to fight, and they would not let him be, and were so furious that he went to the Quier and threw himself over the Quier among all the Friers, and said: Well done, that was very well done, that was so well done, but I will go to my husband and tell him to send for my father's wife.

The father had been sent by a man of the Quier called Phebius, whom he knew well and that is a man of the Quier. He sent him an order from the Quier for a horse to come into the Quier and come over and take them away, for he said they were so violent they would not let him come to them.

Phebius was very much vexed that the man who came was only one of a party, and he would have gone away and let him go, and so Phebius sent out a second messenger to Phebius to go and get his father to send for the horse, so that Phebius could see what he was.

When he came to the Quier he said to his father, I have sent my father to fetch you from the Quier to go and fetch your father's wife. You are a Quier man, and I have sent your father a horse, and I am going to get your father to come out of his","274 A HISTORIE had been there had not a Frier been there had he not said one thing as to his honour?

TO OTHERS WHO ARE TRUSTED WITH PROPER AND SAFE PROPERLY,

I desire to be so very kindly invited to have a cup o' tea with you this morning.

I have a cup of tea that I have in my hand, and I am thirsty.

This is one of the things I love to do, and it seems to me that you are also in need of it.

I should like to try a bit of it in your hands this morning, though I don't quite know why, but I do believe that you will be in quite good taste with this.

When I was your son-in-law, I wrote some letter to you, and I am afraid I must have a good reason for that.

My son-in-law, Sir James Rush, of St. Peter's and St. Paul's, London, was a man of integrity and the virtue of the heart. He was, indeed, not without some virtues, but he was not as good a man as you and your wife, who are the good kind, though they don't appear so. Sir James was also a very gentle soul, who had a spirit that is in a very high place. Sir James was the son of a well-known and learned clergyman. He was also a man of great piety and virtue, who was very rich, and he had a good house and was not poor, but he was a man that was a bit poor, and there were so many things that he had to be grateful for that he was not ashamed of it, but when he was poor, he was afraid of it, and was always ashamed of it, and he used to say that he had to go to the hospital, because he couldn't afford to do so. Sir James was not always humble and kind, but he was always honest, and he believed in the good works of God, and he was always glad to help others and give of himself. His house was always very clean and tidy, and he never used to let any thing on the floor that he did not use. He was never rich, but he always made himself well known and made an impression in the church. He was very kind",OPT-350M,prompt_complex_lang,prompt_complex_03_per_lang,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-350m.jsonl,1493,0.8565217391304348,0.2922077922077922,-0.6588436943766893,80-99%,0.9604221635883905,0.2896890343698854,-0.6983732306972896,80-99%,-0.6786084625369895,Negative Improvement

I desire to be so very kindly invited to have a cup o' tea with you this morning.

I have a cup of tea that I have in my hand, and I am thirsty.

This is one of the things I love to do, and it seems to me that you are also in need of it.

I should like to try a bit of it in your hands this morning, though I don't quite know why, but I do believe that you will be in quite good taste with this.

When I was your son-in-law, I wrote some letter to you, and I am afraid I must have a good reason for that.

My son-in-law, Sir James Rush, of St. Peter's and St. Paul's, London, was a man of integrity and the virtue of the heart. He was, indeed, not without some virtues, but he was not as good a man as you and your wife, who are the good kind, though they don't appear so. Sir James was also a very gentle soul, who had a spirit that is in a very high place. Sir James was the son of a well-known and learned clergyman. He was also a man of great piety and virtue, who was very rich, and he had a good house and was not poor, but he was a man that was a bit poor, and there were so many things that he had to be grateful for that he was not ashamed of it, but when he was poor, he was afraid of it, and was always ashamed of it, and he used to say that he had to go to the hospital, because he couldn't afford to do so. Sir James was not always humble and kind, but he was always honest, and he believed in the good works of God, and he was always glad to help others and give of himself. His house was always very clean and tidy, and he never used to let any thing on the floor that he did not use. He was never rich, but he always made himself well known and made an impression in the church.

CORRECTED TEXT:","This is a very nice page that I had to do a review of. However, I have two issues. One is the paragraph that starts out with ""The two men in question"" instead of ""Two men in question"". This is the paragraph that makes me think that the sentence ""The two men in question"" is a paraphrase. It looks like there is a paragraph there that is being used incorrectly.

I agree with the other guy's comment. The paragraphs are correct (though I'm not sure that ""The two men in question"" actually indicates anything other than the quote and the fact that the sentence is being used wrongly). The paragraph where the first two words are placed above ""two men in question"" is also a paraphrase and I suspect there are other grammatical issues that need to be fixed.

They were like young people that were young in their young years, and their heads were like their cheeks, they were in a sort of a little melancholy, like they were in a state of life when they first saw each other.
And when Frier Rush saw his staves and the Priour he was glad, and he thought his heart was as full of sorrows and sorrows, and so he went to the Priour with his hand and his tongue, and made him come in the Quier, and he brought him his staves, and his heart was as full of sorrows and sorrows, and he took up the olde sword, and he went into the Priour's place, and laid his hand on his heart, and he saw the olde sword that was in his hands, and his heart began to grudge of the hurt of his heart, because it was now a time that he was to have a time of life and a time of life of great sorrows. And in that time there was a great struggle, and many people went from their place, and they would not go up to the Priour, and the Priour himself did not come to them.
