CORRECTED TEXT:","His time he spent in prayer, meditation, and such divine exercises, and did seek by.","OF FRYER BACON. 249 my studies have found the secrets of the stars. The books that I have made of them do serve as precedents to our greatest doctors, so excellent hath my judgment been therein. Likewise, I have found out the secrets of trees, plants, and stones, with their several uses, yet all this knowledge of mine I esteem so lightly that I wish I were ignorant and knew nothing, for the knowledge of these things, as I have truly found, serveth not to better a man in goodness but only to make him proud and think too well of himself. What has all my knowledge of natures secrets gained me? Only this, the loss of a better knowledge, the loss of divine studies, which makes the immortal part of man, his soul, blessed. I have found that my knowledge has been a heavy burden and has kept down my good thoughts, but I will remove the cause, which is these books which I do purpose here before you all to burn. They all entreated him to spare the books because in them there were those things that after-ages might receive great benefit by. He would not hearken unto them, but threw them all into the fire, and in that flame burnt the greatest learning in the world. Then did he dispose of all his goods. Some part he gave to poor scholars, and some he gave to other poor folks. Nothing left he for himself. He then caused a cell to be made in the church-wall where he locked himself in, and there remained till his death. His time he spent in prayer, meditation, and such divine exercises and did seek by all means to make his peace with God.",GPT-3.5,prompt_complex_02,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl,1523,0.9550561797752809,0.9325842696629213,-0.02352941176470594,80-99%,0.972168284789644,0.9010989010989011,-0.07310399321051782,80-99%,-0.04831670248761188,Negative Improvement

Then they sat down to breakfast, which being ended, they went home and did such things as were there to be done. When his dame saw that he had so soon ended his business, she thought that he was a profitable servant and said little but let him alone. In the evening, Rush demanded of his master what he should do the next Morrow. His master appointed him twice as much as he did the day before, which Rush refused not but got up early in the morning and went to the field and about his work. So soon as his master was ready, he took his man's breakfast and came to the field, thinking to help Rush, but he was no sooner come from his house but the Priest came to see his wife and presently she made ready some good meat for them to be merry with all and while it was a-dressing, they sat sporting together, who had been there should have seen many loving touches. And when the goodman came to the field, he found that Rush had done all that which he appointed, whereof he had great marvel. Then they sat down to breakfast and as they sat together, Rush beheld his master's shoes and perceived that for lack of greasing, they were very hard. Then said Rush to his master, ""Why are not your shoes better greased? I marvel that you can go in them, they're so hard. Have you no more at home?"" ""Yes,"" said his master, ""I have another pair lying under a great chest at home in my chamber.""

So the Prior sent for Rush, and when he was come before him and all his brethren, the Prior said, ""Rush, it is so. Thou hast been here a long season, and we have found thee hitherto a true and diligent servant. Wherefore we will that thou be promoted and take upon thee an habit as we have, and become a brother among us."" Rush answered and said, ""My masters, I thank you all."" Then the Prior gave Rush an habit, and put it on his back, and so Rush became a brother in the place. Nevertheless, he kept his office still.

CORRECTED TEXT:",CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE.,"CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. 283

Certains intérêts purement humains s'attachent aux plus petites choses de la vie. On ignore souvent les sentiments que réveillent en nous des objets insignifiants pour autrui, les associations multiples que leur contact évoque, les souvenirs dont ils sont les symboles, et qui lentement se nouent autour d'eux. 

Dans une rue où demeurait Marguerite, on aurait vu parfois une vieille fille mince et pâle, qui marchait lentement, le dos voûté, le regard distrait, et qui s'arrêtait de temps à autre devant une boutique ouverte. Ainsi aurait-elle paru occupée à une course futile, si on ne l'avait observée de plus près. Presque toujours elle portait un petit paquet enveloppé de papier brun qu'elle tenait serré contre elle, et qu'elle examinait avec complaisance, comme si elle y eût trouvé un charme secret. Parfois aussi, elle eût une boîte encombrante, ou un sac qu'elle tenait de la main gauche, tandis que la main droite tendait un objet menu à qui passait près d'elle. Ce pouvait être un enfant qui, joyeux, courait montrer le présent à sa mère; ou un pauvre diable qui regardait la pièce qu'il venait de recevoir avec reconnaissance; ou un mendiant qui, poli, baissait la tête pour remercier.

Certains intérêts purement humains s'attachent aux plus petites choses de la vie. On ignore souvent les sentiments que réveillent en nous des objets insignifiants pour autrui, les associations multiples que leur contact évoque, les souvenirs dont ils sont les symboles, et qui lentement se nouent autour d'eux. 

Dans une rue où demeurait Marguerite, on aurait vu parfois une vieille fille mince et pâle, qui marchait lentement, le dos voûté, le regard distrait, et qui s'arrêtait de temps à autre devant une boutique ouverte. Ainsi aurait-elle paru occupée à une course futile, si on ne l'avait observée de plus près. Presque toujours elle portait un petit paquet enveloppé de papier brun qu'elle tenait serré contre elle, et qu'elle examinait avec complaisance, comme si elle y eût trouvé un charme secret. Parfois aussi, elle eût une boîte encombrante, ou un sac qu'elle tenait de la main gauche, tandis que la main droite tendait un objet menu à qui passait près d'elle.

Certains intérêts purement humains s'attachent aux plus petites choses de la vie. On ignore souvent les sentiments que réveillent en nous des objets insignifiants pour autrui, les associations multiples que leur contact évoque, les souvenirs dont ils sont les symboles, et qui lentement se nouent autour d'eux. 

Dans une rue où demeurait Marguerite, on aurait vu parfois une vieille fille mince et pâle, qui marchait lentement, le dos voûté, le regard distrait, et qui s'arrêtait de temps à autre devant une boutique ouverte. Ainsi aurait-elle paru occupée à une course futile, si on ne l'avait observée de plus près. Presque toujours elle portait un petit paquet enveloppé de papier brun qu'elle tenait serré contre elle, et qu'elle examinait avec complaisance, comme si elle y eût trouvé un charme secret. Parfois aussi, elle eût une boîte encombrante, ou un sac qu'elle tenait de la main gauche, tandis que la main droite tendait un objet menu à qui passait près d'elle. Ce pouvait être un enfant qui, joyeux, courait montrer le présent à sa mère; ou un pauvre diable qui regardait la pièce qu'il venait de recevoir avec reconnaissance; ou un mendiant qui, poli, baissait la tête pour remercier.

Certains intérêts purement humains s'attachent aux plus petites choses de la vie. On ignore souvent les sentiments que réveillent en nous des objets insignifiants pour autrui, les associations multiples que leur contact évoque, les souvenirs dont ils sont les symboles, et qui lentement se nouent autour d'eux. 

Dans une rue où demeurait Marguerite, on aurait vu parfois une vieille fille mince et pâle, qui marchait lentement, le dos voûté, le regard distrait, et qui s'arrêtait de temps à autre devant une boutique ouverte. Ainsi aurait-elle paru occupée à une course futile, si on ne l'avait observée de plus près. Presque toujours elle portait un petit paquet enveloppé de papier brun qu'elle tenait serré contre elle, et qu'elle examinait avec complaisance, comme si elle y eût trouvé un charme secret. Parfois aussi, elle eût une boîte encombrante, ou un sac qu'elle tenait de la main gauche, tandis que la main droite tendait un objet menu à qui passait près d'elle. Ce pouvait être un enfant qui, joyeux, courait montrer le présent à sa mère; ou un pauvre diable qui regardait la pièce qu'il venait de recevoir avec reconnaissance; ou un mendiant qui, poli, baissait la tête pour remercier. Et toujours la vieille fille s'éloignait vite sans attendre les remerciements ni questionner leur destination. C'étaient des souvenirs laissés à des amies d'enfance ou des dons à de pauvres gens du voisinage qu'elle avait coutume de secourir.

Certains intérêts purement humains s'attachent aux plus petites choses de la vie. On ignore souvent les sentiments que réveillent en nous des objets insignifiants pour autrui, les associations multiples que leur contact évoque, les souvenirs dont ils sont les symboles, et qui lentement se nouent autour d'eux. 

Dans une rue où demeurait Marguerite, on aurait vu parfois une vieille fille mince et pâle, qui marchait lentement, le dos voûté, le regard distrait, et qui s'arrêtait de temps à autre devant une boutique ouverte. Ainsi aurait-elle paru occupée à une course futile, si on ne l'avait observée de plus près. Presque toujours elle portait un petit paquet enveloppé de papier brun qu'elle tenait serré contre elle, et qu'elle examinait avec complaisance, comme si elle y eût trouvé un charme secret. Parfois aussi, elle eût une boîte encombrante, ou un sac qu'elle tenait de la main gauche, tandis que la main droite tendait un objet menu à qui passait près d'elle. Ce pouvait être un enfant qui, joyeux, courait montrer le présent à sa mère; ou un pauvre diable qui regardait la pièce qu'il venait de recevoir avec reconnaissance; ou un mendiant qui, poli, baissait la tête pour remercier. Et toujours la vieille fille s'éloignait vite sans attendre les remerciements ni questionner leur destination.

Certains intérêts purement humains s'attachent aux plus petites choses de la vie.

Dans une rue où demeurait Marguerite, on aurait vu parfois une vieille fille mince et pâle, qui marchait lentement, le dos voûté, le regard distrait, et qui s'arrêtait de temps à autre devant une boutique ouverte. Ainsi aurait-elle paru occupée à une course futile, si on ne l'avait observée de plus près. Presque toujours elle portait un petit paquet enveloppé de papier brun qu'elle tenait serré contre elle, et qu'elle examinait avec complaisance, comme si elle y eût trouvé un charme secret. Parfois aussi, elle eût une boîte encombrante, ou un sac qu'elle tenait de la main gauche, tandis que la main droite tendait un objet menu à qui passait près d'elle. Ce pouvait être un enfant qui, joyeux, courait montrer le présent à sa mère; ou un pauvre diable qui regardait la pièce qu'il venait de recevoir avec reconnaissance; ou un mendiant qui, poli, baissait la tête pour remercier.

CORRECTED TEXT:","Quelques minutes après, elle était plongée dans un engourdissement profond.","CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. 283

Certains intérêts purement humains s'attachent aux plus petites choses de la vie. On ignore souvent les sentiments que réveillent en nous des objets insignifiants pour autrui, les associations multiples que leur contact évoque, les souvenirs dont ils sont les symboles, et qui lentement se nouent autour d'eux. 

Dans une rue où demeurait Marguerite, on aurait vu parfois une vieille fille mince et pâle, qui marchait lentement, le dos voûté, le regard distrait, et qui s'arrêtait de temps à autre devant une boutique ouverte. Ainsi aurait-elle paru occupée à une course futile, si on ne l'avait observée de plus près. Presque toujours elle portait un petit paquet enveloppé de papier brun qu'elle tenait serré contre elle, et qu'elle examinait avec complaisance, comme si elle y eût trouvé un charme secret. Parfois aussi, elle eût une boîte encombrante, ou un sac qu'elle tenait de la main gauche, tandis que la main droite tendait un objet menu à qui passait près d'elle. Ce pouvait être un enfant qui, joyeux, courait montrer le présent à sa mère; ou un pauvre diable qui regardait la pièce qu'il venait de recevoir avec reconnaissance; ou un mendiant qui, poli, baissait la tête pour remercier. Et toujours la vieille fille s'éloignait vite sans attendre les remerciements ni questionner leur destination. C'étaient des souvenirs laissés à des amies d'enfance ou des dons à de pauvres gens du voisinage qu'elle avait coutume de secourir. Dans l'acte qui instituait le jeune avocat pour son héritier, ces divers vœux étaient exprimés dans la forme la plus simple et la plus touchante. Elle s'excusait d'avoir si peu à offrir, et priait qu'on lui tint compte de l'intention sans s'arrêter à la valeur des choses. Chaque leg était d'ailleurs approprié à la personne avec un soin délicat qui y ajoutait un nouveau prix. Marguerite eut une dernière attention: elle laissa son secrétaire ouvert et plaça sur la tablette la pièce qui rendait Ludovic maître de tout régler chez elle et d'agir à son gré. Près du testament était l'anneau, ce triste et mystérieux emblème.
