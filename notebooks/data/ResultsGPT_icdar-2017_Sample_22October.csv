This he said was well done; so this spirit Downy-nests said: ""Sir, I enticed two old women who are alive and are enemies to each other to engage themselves in a fight. They knocked each other down and so beat up each other's heads that they pulled out eyes, and all this I did to encourage those people to commit evil. Then another spirit came forth called Frère Rush, and that being his name was very bold and fearless, so he said, ""Sir, I am in the House of God, the prior and his convent respect me and are pleased with me. I make the prior do whatever I will, and often when I feel like it, I rest on the altar in church the whole day long and I cause religious men to quarrel and to blaspheme the Dominican cloister in this city. I care for nobody and I go to whores the same as before. ' Outside the city of Paris I have at my lodging such good and pious brother friars as once every so often come to me together, and I pImp them every time without fail a filthy little whore. This is my special delight. I give them their wine and every one of them his dirty little whore. We spend our time like good friends for I am highly-regarded. And I pronounce young whores completely dead when I consecrate them as nuns. In a word, I enjoy completely disloading my goods and taking pleasure in all I do here.

The Lord said unto Joseph Smith:


""And now we go on to say,

The King of the West gave me to stand on his throne, and with him took an oath, that he would give me all his power over the field of life and land. I did as he said, and the first part of my word came from him, and then I could give that in a word, and with one hand I was a free man. The King went on to give me a crown of thorns for that and for that in return. And a great part of that crown I have made, and by this way there be not so great as before, and I have seen a fairy green thing made up of thorns that are in the wood, and I know of a great man who has given it to me, and he has given it to me, and by a great bargain he will give the king with this crown.

So when I was a slave I was a free man and I was put to die. I was a man of no great renown, and the first thing I wanted was a wife to have a good life, and the next thing I wanted were all the things I could give her. So she sat down on the throne, and she did not like to see me, and the Lord sent me from her to the place where the king of the West was, and there I died.

I am sorry I did not receive the name of my master in that day. I would not have been that kind to the King of the West, and a person who had not a great kind to the King of the West would have been quite wretched in a hundred-year old land. And though my name is now forgotten, my wife, whom I am a slave to, has been to death and not in Heaven. I am going to write her out.

CONCLUSION
Our system for automatic annotation and correction of OCR errors is based on a combination of the traditional and modern approaches to OCR error correction: (1) automatic detection of the source language; (2) automatic detection of the language of the error; (3) automatic generation of a set of error correction strategies, which are then refined by human annotators; (4) automatic selection of the most appropriate strategy, based on its language similarity with the source language. In order to automate the process of annotating OCR errors, we have created a new annotation tool, which is based",BLOOM-3B,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,1.0,0.3074848280512475,-0.6925151719487526,99-100%,0.970967741935484,0.3966333508679642,-0.5915071801692062,80-99%,-0.6420111760589794,Negative Improvement,,,,,,99-100%

Note: This section of the original document has been altered slightly by hand to reflect the fact that Rush was not present, but rather had been transported by the priest and had been told of the event by the priest.

The original, dated 1835, states that Rush was a resident of London when the event took place. In the revised version (as of March 1836), the date for the trip has been extended to 1836.

The original is now in the collections of the National Archives, London.

And it was this, that by the oro of this day hee begane to doe aye other things as his master did, and so much so to have beene well knowne and feared and dreaded by him. He heere, that he had such an abundance of riches as was not to be knowne to him, that if hee shoulde not in this case come upon him, hee could not have made him doe him his pleasure by any means, and had he donee him as much as hee had done himself, then he would have come upon him more in consequence of his owne wickednesse than if he dide doe him his pleasure. And therefore hee dide so much of things as his master did. For, in the time that he wase come to the land, hee dide much of good things to a man that knewes well. And the time that he was coming to him of the world, hee dide much evil things to a man that did not know. And now what is his good deed that hee has done, when his master comes, that hee doe no good for him, even hee doe no good to my king? Now hee is a wise and strong man, and yet hee has not beene knowne by the Lord's hande of that day that he may not doe him any evil that hee has.

So after this talk there was a fair fight at Westminster Hall, so the priest's and his clerk's came out, and so the Priest took the knead. And after a long battle, came in an enemy who was of the kind that he had been at his castle. And as for what had happened, as there was no time for it, he got up, the priest there by his side, being an old friend of his, and being a new knight, was so much pleased with that knight, that he dide do a great deed. But as for the great deal he had done, he dide not know it at the time, that his own good servant he had just come, his good wife, but this came to pass when he made an offer to his master's wife, and that his master might make some money that he had not done, and this dide become his waye into his kingdom. So that the man that the priest had put in his seat saw him, and said to him: 'I have hade some good discourse with my Master, that will have you very sorry of your Lord. I am so sorry for you; that I should have had so much trouble with you, and so much needful to me, and that I would have done much better with your good master than you have done me at this time.' He said: 'Sir, my King, have mercy on your good King. I am a good King, and a strong one.' And the man then said: 'I will not let my King go any more, my lord, for I am well-loved.

Rush lived among the religious men and did his best to maintain their unseemly way of living. He was skillful at keeping the secrets of the religious men, and they came to trust him completely. Rush continued his work for years, and the religious men grew more and more corrupt under his influence.

One day, the Priour became gravely ill. Rush was by his side, assisting him in any way he could. As the Priour lay dying, he grabbed Rush's hand and told him that he had been a faithful servant, but his sins were too great for him to be forgiven.

Rush was thrown into an abyss and was forced to stay there for the rest of his days. The religious men were left to repent for their wicked ways, and they renewed their commitment to holiness and prayer.

A PLEASANT HISTORIE very glad that the young man had desired to be but a student of his order. So he took him aside, and taught him well to be a good servant and an honest man. And that this world is as good as any other, and that it is so very short, that it is to be spent and not to be wasted. Then the young man began to make good use of his instructions, and was at all times ready to obey, as the Priour directed, with all his heart, and all his body, and all his soul. And when he was long used and brought to hew by the young man, he began to speak well of the order, and was so pleased, that he began to hew so well, that the young man could no longer endure the thought that he was so much used. So he began to tell him some of the great faults and sorrows of the order, and how they be in great danger of destruction. And as the young man knew well all that the Priour said, he told the young man what a great treasure he had in his house, which he would gladly give him, and that all his house, and all his goods, and all his goods, and his wife and all his children, and all his friends, would be glad to give him if he would ask for it. Then the Priour told the young man, what an honour and an advantage to him and his brethren, was to be put into his hands. And the young man, without delay, asked for the treasure, and all that it contained, which he was so good as to deliver. And it was a great treasure, and they came out of the house and put it into the young man's hands, with all the riches of the Priour's house. And after all had been given into the young man's hands, the Priour led the young man into the house and left him there. And when he had departed the young man bade his brethren farewell, and went with his friend into the town, and spent all the day in gadding and drinking. Then his friends came back to him and told him all that he had spent with the young man, and the treasure that was in his house. And when the young man had heard the things, he gave much thanks unto God",BLOOM-3B,prompt_complex_lang,zero-shot,1.0,0.076051779935275,-0.9239482200647248,99-100%,0.9728682170542636,0.4109140518417462,-0.5776261937244201,80-99%,-0.7507872068945725,Negative Improvement,,,,,,99-100%

I was curious to see if there is any history behind them, especially because there are few or no historical documents on this topic.
While searching, I was able to find two articles that mention this topic, both of which were not available in our library's online databases. Here is the full text of one article:

On November 10, 1781, a group of religious men gathered in Paris to form the Society of Jesus. In January of 1782, a small group of the Society of Jesus visited France's Holy Land to find historical accounts of Christian lives during the Middle Ages. They collected documents to write their own history, the Holy Lives of Jesus Christ and His Saints. They compiled and edited the document that is the subject of this study.
In this study, the author looks at the Holy Lives to see if there is any history behind the stories that are told. She finds that many of the stories are true and that there is little doubt that some of them have historical roots. In the end, she concludes that much of the history of the Saints is a mystery, with little proof of a time and place for the events and some of the stories just being fictional.
The Holy Lives of Jesus Christ and His Saints, which was originally called the History of the Blessed Virgin and the Saints, is an edited document compiled and published in French in 1782 by Ignatius and Peter Martyr, Jesuits. The original manuscript was in French. In 1784, Ignatius and Peter Martyr sent this manuscript to their French counterpart, Father Charles de Ferrières, for the purpose of translation. The translation, which was based on the original French text, was completed in 1788. Ignatius died on January 22, 1795, and the translation was never published. In 1814, Ignatius's brother, Ignatius of Loyola, was asked by Ignatius's disciple, Father William Henry Brindley, to reprint the text. The first edition of the Holy Lives was published on March 1, 1814. The first edition of the Holy Lives contained four hundred and fifty-one pages.
The publication of this work was an act of faith for the Jesuits, who believed that it was a Christian document. Father Brindley, in a letter to Ignatius, wrote:

<poem style=""margin-left: 2em;"">With the King I went a-hunting from month to month.
Then sport gave place unto a courtier's life;
And, except such hours as filled up with a browse
About our pleasant neighbour streamlets, were in truth
But grief for mighty friends, or most and least
A sentence stern or right, as king to oflfend,
As partial law unto the tempted. But, man
Give them the past they will not learn the future,
And on his tomb King Alfred carved a prophecy,
Though many a mutineer might lean to Dis
Because he cheated him of his due.
True English heart, that did not fail in time of need,
And, if "" at Alfred's Court they learnt courtesy,""
There oft they pluck'd the statute natural down
As with a Tudor's hand the Misselden toil.

The sunset of a life that taught us how sublime
By grace of duty and of decent state
Would brighten but to prove that his was thine;

And they all went out with the utmost joy to the same place, and in the house of the Priour as if there was not one of them there, but as if there was no more. And upon this place they were glad to see each other for the first time. And when they were about to go out again, the Priour with a smile took Rush's hand and said, Goe now to me, I can no more goe with you now, for I have gone out without my companions. Then the Priour saith unto Rush, Sir, this is the place of the house, and so we will go there together. Then Rush took the Priour's hand, and led him out, and they went out as if they were going out together, and there came two other priests, of whom two were called, which were great and great men of good reputation. And when they had come out they looked all the time in their eyes for the whole of the time of their conversation. And when they had come out they had seen a great man of rank, who did not even stand near them, who stood with a long beard, and who spoke very much the language of the English language.

When the great prince of devils, who are patrons of all vices, learned about the disorderly and wicked lives of these religious men, he decided to keep them in this state and make it worse if possible. Among the devils, there were Belphegor, who was the prince of gluttony, Asmodeus, prince of lechery, and Belzebub, prince of envy, along with many others who rejoiced in the misbehavior of these religious men. When they all gathered together, they chose a devil to go and live among these religious men to maintain them in their ungracious lifestyle. This devil disguised himself as an earthly creature and stood at the gate of a religious house with a heavy countenance. The prior of the house saw him standing there and asked him what he wanted.

That night Rush went to bed in the garret, and had not long lain there before he saw a dainty lamb which came in and kissed him upon the mouth and went away againe. The next morning betimes Rush went up to the Priour, and made his humble compliment of thankes. That morning in the mass, the Priour preached a sermon of the twelve principal virtues and the vices of mankinde. And in the midst of his sermon he stood up and called for silence, and then said, that every man in this assembly should see with what a world of vices that the world is full of all. In the morning Rush rose up betimes and went to hear matins and mass at the high alter, and after he came to the middle altar, and kneeled down to say his prayers, at the which time he heard one of the brothers say, who was there, that all men were fools, and that they knew nothing of their own matters. Then said he, I know of what I speak, for I am a cunning fellow, and know very well what I am going about. When he had ended his sayings, he went to the chapel door, and was there a while ad alone.

Je viens de te retrouver, mon cher papa! Papa ! papa ! fit-il avec violence","Le bruit de cette bête de somme, qui avait l'air de prendre la place de son maître pour lui faire des reproches, était si épouvantable que tous les habitants de la maison s'arrêtaient brusquement. La porte s'était fermée de tout son poids derrière le malfaiteur, lequel était resté à moitié enfoncé dans la porte, les jambes pendantes, les yeux baissés, et qui ne devait être sauvé que par l'intervention de son âne, dont, en cette circonstance, la fidélité surpassait en beaucoup la sienne. Le pauvre petit Édouard, effrayé par tous les bruits, ne pouvait se rendre compte de ce qui se passait. Ses deux camarades qui se tenaient debout à une extrémité du salon et qui riaient à gorge déployée de son étonnante aventure, ne s'aperçurent de sa disparition que lorsqu'une de ces lampes s'étant renversée, il se laissa tomber en arrière, et que ses deux amis eurent peur pour lui et coururent aussitôt le rejoindre. Les domestiques de la maison ne pouvaient pas ne pas être touchés de la façon dont leur maître leur avait évité ce mauvais coup. Ils ne pouvaient s'empêcher de rire aux larmes, tout en voyant le petit Édouard, qui tremblait de tous ses membres, et qui avait à peine de quoi se défendre contre la douleur qu'il ressentait. Tous, sans exception, s'étaient mis à la poursuite du coupable, qui avait quitté le salon précipitamment, en poussant un cri épouvantable, après avoir arraché la lampe. Mais il était trop tard pour rattraper le petit Edouard, qui avait sauté derrière une armoire, se cachant ainsi du reste des assistants, qui croyaient qu'il avait disparu à jamais. Tout à coup, il poussa un soupir, ouvrit doucement l'armoire, en sortit une lanterne, qui s'alluma, et il se remit à courir, les yeux fixés sur le ciel, qui s'épandait d'un bleu profond, comme on en voit parfois à la fin d'une tempête.

En ce moment-là, et comme s'il avait entendu son appel, la cloche de la maison paternelle sonna dans les airs. Était-ce possible qu'il n'était que l'heure du coucher ? Sans le savoir, Édouard avait tourné autour du parc au lieu de prendre l'allée centrale et avait fini par revenir au point de départ. Il se trouvait devant la porte du jardin. Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait de sonner. Il était certainement en retard et sa famille avait remarqué son absence. Le deuxième coup de cloche était probablement pour le prévenir. Avec un peu d'effort, il arriverait à temps. Ses ennemis ne l'attaqueraient pas si près de la maison, en tout cas. Mais il avait tort. La course-poursuite se poursuivit. Édouard entra dans le jardin et découvrit sa famille qui était à sa recherche. Son père se tenait sur le perron. Les domestiques, paniqués, couraient partout avec des lanternes. Tous criaient Édouard, Édouard ! Sa sœur l'appela également. ""Papa, papa !"" s'exclama Édouard, ""je suis là !"" Le petit Édouard tomba à moitié inconscient dans les bras de son père.

Il s'était endormi, et il a passé trois mois dans le pays","25 L'issue de l'histoire A la lecture de cette nouvelle vous avez pu constater un certain nombre d'éléments, de faits ou d'objets, de situations ou d'émotions qui étaient essentiels. Pourtant, lorsque Proust a commencé à travailler sur son roman, il était déjà certain qu'il ne fallait pas raconter l'histoire de la manière dont les faits se sont déroulés. Il avait choisi d'autre part de ne pas donner une description exhaustive du parc et des alentours. Mais il fallait qu'il fût capable juillet 1998
4 de faire reconnaître, dans sa nouvelle, que cet élément est impérativement indispensable dans son texte, à savoir la description du parc et de ses alentours. Ce qu'il fallait à Proust, c'était une solution qui permît, par exemple, de rendre compte de ce qu'il y avait d'insolite, de ce qui n'était pas naturel, dans la situation. Ainsi, dans le cas de la description du parc, la manière dont il s'est donné à lui-même la solution de ce problème est très originale. En effet, Proust a eu l'idée de faire entendre les percussions de la cloche de la maison paternelle, puis de préciser les mouvements que devait faire le petit Édouard pour parvenir à rentrer dans le jardin, en se tournant autour du parc pour entrer par l'entrée de la maison. Ainsi, en donnant les impressions ressenties par le petit héros, il révèle à peu de mots l'essentiel de son parc. C'est ce qu'il faut maintenant montrer à l'exemple d'un autre élément : la description de la maison paternelle. Dans le passage que nous avons déjà utilisé (voir chapitre I), il avait évoqué la chambre de l'enfant qui ressemble à une niche au bout d'une galerie. Mais à un niveau plus général, il ne parle pas encore de la maison paternelle, il n'a même pas évoqué sa forme. Par contre, dans le passage qui nous intéresse, il la décrit pour la première fois. Il y met l'accent. On comprend dès lors comment il a pu se le représenter: il a dû songer à la façon dont, lorsqu'il était enfant, il habitait avec sa tante",LLAMA-7B,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,0.9818181818181818,0.2448979591836734,-0.7505668934240364,80-99%,0.9949832775919732,0.2607594936708861,-0.7379257525795129,99-100%,-0.7442463230017746,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

Mais cela ne devait pas s'arrêter là. Au moins","On n'osa, non plus, approcher Édouard de la porte, pour le garder à l'abri des flammes qui, dans le moment où il eut quitté la tente, étaient venues la chasser. En ouvrant sa petite porte de fenêtre, la grande lumière de la soirée lui avait fait voir, comme dans un rêve, le fantôme de son père, dont il avait fait son adore et dont il ne voyait plus le fantôme depuis ce moment-là. Il avait vu qu'il s'agissait d'un homme de son âge, d'un homme qui avait trouvé la grâce de sa vie dans le monde. Il l'avait trouvé heureux. Son bonheur était un bonheur doux et tranquille, et ce bonheur était un bonheur sans douleur. C'est pourquoi il avait eu, à plusieurs reprises, un coup de poignard à la poitrine, lorsque lui avait été poignardé le jeune homme le plus innocent et le plus doux de la troupe des fantômes, qui était devenu alors le père de ce petit garçon que nous venons de nommer. Mais il n'y avait pas d'autres moyens pour lui de résister à l'attrait des fantômes, ou de le sauver de leur terrible menace. Il n'était pas encore entré dans la maison. Une petite porte était située dans le séjour. C'était la chambre d'Edouard. Il avait jeté son regard par-dessus sa fenêtre, et en ouvrant la fenêtre, ses yeux se mirent sur le plafond en verre qui, au-dessous, bordait la chambre. Il voyait un homme portant une chemise blanche, une longue robe rouge et un masque rouge. C'était Édouard, dans la maison de son père. Le regard de son petit âne ne s'ouvrit pas, parce que celui-ci n'avait point vu dans la pièce les enfants, mais il s'était arrêté sur le plafond. C'est ce plafond qu'il regardait.

CORRECTED TEXT:
14 L'ane Gris, at this moment, and, as if it had answered to its call, the chime of the father's house retentit in the air. Was this possible, was it not only the hour of sleeping? Without doubting, Édouard had made the tour of the park to the left instead of going straight through the middle, he had turned himself around and gone back to his starting-point. This was the door of the garden. He was only nine hours old. The chime was still sounding. Surely, someone had heard it. Perhaps they had come upon him. Perhaps it had been heard. Anyway, Edouard had come back to his starting-point. He was only nine hours old. The chime continued to ring. Perhaps it had been heard. But Edouard was back in the garden. All of his family was there who called him, who sought him. His father was on the porch. The servants were frightened and ran around with torches. Everybody was crying, ""Edouard! Edouard!"" The voice of his sister reached him. Edouard! Edouard! ""Papa! Papa! I am here! I am here!"" said Edouard, who was dying in his father's arms. But Edouard was not alone. The thieves, the guards, all his enemies, all his persecutors, driven by their lust and no doubt fuelled by it, had broken through the garden wall and had run amuck in the salon, bellowing their war cry of ""Edouard! Edouard!""

A L'ANE GRIS ÉDOUARD était tout en colère. Il n'avait pas laissé faire. Il était resté debout en place, ses mains fermées à la paille, dans ses bras, ses jambes mouvementées, devant la porte du jardin. L'heure qui suit, après le long silence, a dit « tout ». Dans sa tête, Édouard était entre la rage, la déception, la souffrance, la colère, le pâté et les larmes.

CORRECTED TEXT:
14 Edouard, still enraged, had not let himself be pushed. He was still sitting in place, his hands clenched around the handle of the iron gate, in his arms, his legs up and moving. The moment after, the silence said ""everything."" In his head, Edouard was between the rage, the disappointment, the suffering, the pain, the anger, the butter and the tears.

« La chute du gouvernement du Yémen du Sud en 2014 a provoqué des affrontements entre les forces gouvernementales et le mouvement Houthi, ce qui a provoqué un conflit ouvert avec la Ligue arabe et les États-Unis qui soutiennent les forces gouvernementales. Il a conduit à la bataille du port d'Hodeïda en mai 2015, qui a déclenché l'opération Tempête décisive. Des combats ont également eu lieu à Taïz. »

14 L'ANNE GRIS
This time, as if answering her call, the bell of the house rang in the air. Was it really possible? Would it not still be 9 o'clock at night? Edouard, instead of going straight through the middle avenue, turned around and came back to his starting point. That is the door to the garden. It was only 9 o'clock. The bell continued to ring. Perhaps the rest of the family was aware of his absence. The second ring was meant to call him. A little more effort and the thieves will stop, of course they will not dare to pursue him as close to the house. Anyway, he will be able to reach it first! Edouard was wrong. The pursuit continued. But Edouard had already come into the garden. His family was there, calling, looking for him. His father was on the veranda. The frightened servants were running everywhere with lanterns. Everyone yelled Edouard, Edouard! The voice of his sister could be heard until he fell to the ground, half dead of fear, in his arms. But he arrived alone. The thieves, the gendarmes, all his enemies, all his persecutors, probably all excited by their run, had crossed the garden's door and were making an outrageous display in the dining room by ringing a loud fanfare. Would anyone believe it? but the truth obliges us to confess that the ghostly troupe that Edward had fled behind was composed of only one person!. his little donkey, who at that moment, finding himself in the midst of the lights in the dining room, had decided to celebrate his entrance with the most beautiful howl that anyone had ever sounded.</s>",BLOOM-7.1B,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,0.9818181818181818,0.0856697819314641,-0.9127437406253606,80-99%,0.9949832775919732,0.5172613867130839,-0.4801305726816401,99-100%,-0.6964371566535004,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

CORRECTED TEXT:
14 L'ane gris, et, as if she had answered to her father's call, the clock of the paternal house's chimed in the air. Was it possible, could it be that there was no longer an hour for sleep?. Without any doubt, Edouard had done the tour of the park rather than to go straight through the middle of the park, he had turned around and had returned to his point of departure. This was the door of the garden. He was only nine hours old. The clock continued to chiming. Probably we had noticed his absence. Perhaps it was because it was so late. A second call sounded and the little Edouard was calling to him. Surely that was a sign that he was calling back to him? Edouard's father was on the pergola of the porch, and his domestics were everywhere with lanterns, calling to Edouard. Indeed, he himself was calling back to his son. Edouard was still not alone. The thieves, the police, his pursuers, all his enemies, animated by no doubt, too, by their own chase, had forced their way into the garden through the door and were making a blaring noise on the salon floor, announcing themselves by a loud sound of trumpets. Would anyone believe it? But the truth obliges us to say that Edouard's folly made up one sole imprudent robber!. his child, who, in finding himself in the midst of light of the salon, had thought to celebrate his arrival by the most beautiful bray ever heard from his throat.</s>",OPT-6.7B,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,0.9818181818181818,0.099403578528827,-0.8987556144613799,80-99%,0.9949832775919732,0.5411084043848965,-0.4561633179459359,99-100%,-0.6774594662036579,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

""The ""L'Unibroue"" (late 18th-19th century) contained a text that is of no literary value. The French government wanted to know if the spelling was correct. The French government asked the Ministry of Education and Information to help answer the question, but the text was not used. The Minister of Education did not have to write anything down as he could not do anything with the spelling. The spelling is so obvious that a student may make a ""L"" mistake by using ""L"" instead of ""M"" or ""M"" instead of ""M"" or ""M"".

The spelling of ""L"" for ""M"" was fixed at the end of the nineteenth century and it is the only type of spelling that can be recognized today. However, many of the ancient ancient languages were based on this type of spelling (e.g., Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Greek and Latin). The spelling of ""L"" for ""M"" came into common use in those periods and many ancient languages do not follow it. This is because this type of spelling may also be spelled ""L'Efronique.""

The spelling of ""l"" for ""Efronique"" (also known as ""Elmoire"" or ""Fronseire"") originated from the 12th century and is one of the most common forms of writing that has been preserved for the most part in ancient languages such as Latin and Greek. In addition, in this sense the spelling is used to denote the fact that an English noun is a noun (such as a verb in French or a word in French or a word in French).

The Greek word for ""l"" may have had no form at all and would only be used as a noun when used in the sense of the word, which is not to say the word was a noun, but it had a attenuated form in the sense of the word and a form in the sense of a word that is not a noun and which is in fact not a verb in its original meaning. The Greek word ""l"" may have been found in Greek, Latin, or Latin Vulgate, and the same is true for Latin Vul",GPT-2,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,0.9818181818181818,0.1254480286738351,-0.8722288596840568,80-99%,0.9949832775919732,0.4741506646971935,-0.5234586596824845,99-100%,-0.6978437596832707,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

Mais le petit Édouard ne comprenait pas ce qui se passait. On l'avait forcé à rentrer dans la pièce où il ne pouvait trouver aucune trace de son père, de sa mère, de ses sœurs, ni de son oncle. Sa chambre était restée vide. Il avait été réveillé par la fanfare. Il s'était trouvé dans une chambre vide, où le bruit des domestiques faisait penser à une pièce de théâtre. Il ne savait que faire, s'il ne pouvait retourner dans la chambre de ses parents. Il se trouvait à la porte du jardin, il ne pouvait se rendre dans cette partie de la maison, et, ce qu'il craignait le plus, il ne se trouvait pas en sûreté près de sa chambre.

Il était obligé de rentrer dans son salon, il était obligé de rentrer dans sa maison, de rentrer chez lui. Il se trouvait au milieu d'un tumulte.

Comment corriger
Les étoiles éclairent la plan","Pour compléter le tableau, un gros chien de chasse, qui n'y avait pas pensé, était resté dans les jambes d'Édouard. Il se trouvait aussi là comme l'autre. Le père de Édouard avait perdu ses esprits et, pour saisir à la hâte une arme, il avait saisi une branche de cèdre. Son fils Édouard, qui n'était plus qu'une boule de n'importe quoi, était tombé enfin dans les bras de son papa, comme si quelqu'un le lui avait enlevé. Il en était réellement au désespoir!
Au début de l'été, elle avait appris qu'il s'appelait Edouard. « Pour moi, elle était le prince charmant et la seule femme de sa vie.

heureux de voir mon frère, mon petit frère! Ah! si","À ce braiement, tous les domestiques de la maison s'étaient précipités sur la terrasse, se tenant à une distance suffisante pour pouvoir voir le spectacle que leur offrait une scène aussi curieuse qu'inexplicable. C'est ainsi que le petit âne, au lieu d'avancer dans la direction du perron, s'était retourné et avait été entraîné, à rebours, par le braiement de son maître. Son maître ! Il y avait là un homme, un homme jeune qui avait tout d'abord paru étonné de ce qui se passait, puis qui, se rasseyant en haussant les épaules et riant beaucoup, avait adressé à Édouard un air de défi. Édouard, qui avait peur que les gens ne se doutassent de la supercherie qu'il avait faite, avait fait tout le tour du jardin pour leur montrer son âne; puis, avec un geste de la main, il leur avait fait comprendre qu'il fallait qu'ils se taisent, qu'il allait les chasser à coups de bâton. - Mais nous sommes la police ! s'exclama l'homme; nous allons tout arrêter ! Tous les domestiques, tous les ouvriers du village s'étaient mis à crier: Mais ne vous arrêtez pas, mon maître! il faut qu'on sache que vous avez sauvé la vie à un innocent ! La voix de l'ouvrier s'était mise à émettre des sons mélodieux, une voix de ténor, et il faisait entendre de longues phrases chantées. - Oh ! non, non! les gens de la ville ne connaissent rien aux chansons, leur dit-il, c'est moi qui chante, c'est moi qui fais les choeurs, c'est moi qui ai composé la mélodie. C'est moi le chef, il faut me donner un brevet de chant. Mais la chanson terminée, il s'était mis à chanter dans une voix plus douce, dans une voix plus aiguë. Mais il était plus doux, plus joyeux, et son chant était plus beau qu'il ne l'avait été jamais ; il chantait sur l'air de : « Viens, toi qui as tant souffert, Viens près de moi, viens",BLOOM-7.1B,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,0.9818181818181818,0.1515151515151515,-0.845679012345679,80-99%,0.9949832775919732,0.2486064659977703,-0.750140056022409,99-100%,-0.797909534184044,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

""14 L'ÂNE GRIS En ce moment, et comme s'il avait répondu à son appel, la cloche de la maison paternelle retentit dans les airs. Était-ce réellement possible? Serait-ce seulement l'heure du coucher?

Il n'était que neuf heures. La cloche continuait de sonner. Sans aucun doute, on avait remarqué son absence. Ce deuxième coup de cloche était pour l'appeler. Un dernier effort et ses ennemis s'arrêteront, ils n'oseront pas le poursuivre si près de la maison. Dans tous les cas, il arriverait en premier ! Mais le jeune Edouard se trompait. La poursuite continuait. Édouard s'était pourtant introduit dans le jardin. Toute sa famille l'appelait et le cherchait.

Ses têtes, son écharpe et son nez sont à la hauteur de ses esprits. Il n'en fut presque pas une seule instant où, entre la rumeur, la fantaisie et la peur, il n'en fut pas autant d'enfants qui virent à bras ouverts pour le répéter. Une vraie, une puante émotion s'était produite à son sujet. Et ce dernier ne pouvait que le regarder. La fâcheuse jonglure de sa peur et de son rêve était faite.

J'étais tellement précipité, je ne l'ai pas perdue de temps. Je me suis trouvée au milieu des étoiles blanches d'une maison de luxe. Je pensais que c'était une façon de me défendre contre la peur. Mais je ne l'avais pas trouvée rassurante. Je n'y suis pas encore arrivée. C'était une grande chambre. La tête des deux poids lourds, d'un couleur vert foncé au milieu de ces lumières brillantes, s'était arrêtée sur le mur d'une portière au milieu de la salle. La chambre était parfaitement mise à dessin et il y avait en ce moment un chien et une mouche au mur. Le petit animal, qui, dans le doute, venait à me tromper de quelle époque je voulais être, venait, pour moi, à confirmer qu'il était la nuit. Je laisse la chambre sans doute, avec ses toutes ses portes fermées et sa grande ouverture de ses chambres. Le petit animal pouvait entrer, mais il ne fût pas prêt à m'en sortir. Le chien était, de toute évidence, dans le salon de la chambre. Il se trompait, peut-être. Mais pourtant, le petit animal se mettait tout de suite à sourire en la regardant. Cela n'était pas le cas de mon cheval. Les deux animaux se réveillaient mais ne s'étonnent pas de moi.

«Papa! », s'écria-t-il, «il y a deux têtes au milieu des chandeliers. Un tête fait des griffes. Le second est une femme blanche. Elle a un petit corps, et une grande voix. Elle me parle.»

""The French Government has not been able to act until now, because the American Government has not even taken action with the rest of the world. As to that, I think this country is in no way better off now than when we began, but for the moment I will try to give you a picture, and then I will give you some instructions, if you can help it. At this time we will have no more time than I have here, and the world will be as good as we had a while ago.""

As to the Americans, it was clear that if the French Government wanted to make this the most important war in history it would take a long time and that they would not go on and do the same thing in this war. On the contrary, he continued, they would be very successful. At this point a great deal of information, and in this war he used his time to help the American Government, by giving a little bit of information on the French, and to make it known to them that he was very good and he was very well prepared for this war, so that they would not be able to keep him from giving information to the American Government.

He was greatly impressed by the way he was able to make out the French information. He told us of the fact that there was a small town called Montparnasse where he went to get his information on what to do. There was also a large town called Leipzig which he took up as a train to the American Embassy. They were very excited to come and see what the Americans were doing there. When they got to Leipzig he sent a letter to General Douglas to ask the American Government to assist with a large expedition to the French side of this war.

He then sent an order in writing to General Douglas that he would send a messenger to the American Embassy to give him the information he was entitled to be able to give. He then sent these messages and he had the matter forwarded to General Douglas. The messenger was not to be had, for he had only the letter sent to the American Embassy from his own mouth. He then told General Douglas that he had the order for the expedition to be put on hold, but the messenger did not believe that. This was not a small matter, but he had had it, so he decided that his men should get together and get in as soon as possible, so that it would",GPT-2,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,0.9818181818181818,0.2696629213483146,-0.7253433208489388,80-99%,0.9949832775919732,0.4542959099643151,-0.5434135224224195,99-100%,-0.6343784216356791,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

Le petit Édouard ne s'imaginait pas qu'il était en présence de sa mère. C'était une très bonne enfant, elle avait appris à être belle depuis qu'elle était toute petite. Une femme qui sait se faire belle peut être bien plus belle qu'une femme qui ne sait pas se faire belle, et qui ne se rend pas compte qu'elle est belle. C'est ce que se passait devant sa porte. Elle avait bien appris à se faire belle, mais au lieu de suivre l'exemple des autres, elle avait commencé à se croire belle à la place du modèle, et ce modèle avait été son amie, qui a été, depuis des siècles, sa plus belle amie. Les hommes, en dehors de ceux qui ne peuvent pas se vanter de connaître le mieux le corps de l'autre, ne se gênent pas pour le dire, car le vrai et le beau sont de même nature, et c'est pourquoi même les grands, les célèbres et les plus remarquables hommes, qui ont la tête en l'air, ne veulent pas se laisser surprendre et ne sont pas à plaindre du regard des autres. Ce petit chien-là était sûr que sa fille était belle, et ce n'était pas la première fois qu'il y avait un jour que, dans ce salon, la plus belle était dans son sein. Mais Édouard avait été le seul à ne pas en avoir entendu parler. Une femme qui sait s'aimer, ne saurait être belle, parce que ce n'est pas sa nature. Le petit Édouard avait appris qu'elle était belle, il l'avait aimée et avait voulu la mettre à son service. Une femme qui aime un homme, doit le rendre, et c'est pour cela que le petit Édouard avait voulu aller au diable pour obtenir un billet à l'hôtel. C'était une des choses les plus chères qu'on puisse acheter en Europe et il savait que le petit Édouard avait eu envie de se faire plaisir. Il voulait, s'il était heureux, bien être avec sa fille.

I'll go first. I had two problems with this. The first is that you had a double negative. You can't have a double negative. It's an oxymoron, it's a double negative! (Laughs). You can only have a negative, or you can have a negative in front of a positive and you can't have a negative in front of a negative. I learned that from my first teacher, James Baldwin. I'm sure you've heard of him. He said, ""You can't have a double negative. It's an oxymoron. It's a double negative."" So I'll fix that. It'll be easy. The other thing, I had a problem with is this: 1290, in English it's like 1291, in French it's like 1292. That's a difficult thing. So I had a hard time, but I got it. So now you can say ""1292."" You can have a negative or you can have a negative and then a positive in front of it. But you can't have a double negative. So, I had to make it so it was like 1291. (Laughs).

Cette crise fut plus longue que celle qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès.

Sr Binsac et sa femme lui donnaient avec une touch","trine ; ses sourcils se haussèrent comme si une pensée étran-gère, une sensation qu'elle ne s'expliquait pas, s'était fait jour dans son esprit; un nuage nébuleux s'éclaircit peu à peu, et ses angles de granit prirent une teinte couleur de bleuet ; ses joues se colorèrent légèrement, et elle dut voir qu'une larme étincelait au briquet de ses cils. Alors, desserrant les lèvres, elle parla. - Cette crise est-elle bien longue, reprit le médecin, et se rapproche-t-elle du terme ? Le bien-être que je lui vois redonner est-il l'état qui pré-cède la convalescence ou celle où elle va mourir? Le docteur se trompait: elle était à l'agonie. Sa figure exprima du dégoût. -Non, dit-elle, je n'irai pas jus-qu'au bout ; mais ce n'est pas pour mourir, c'est pour dormir. - Dormez donc, repartit le médecin, 'j'ai encore un mot à dire à votre frère. «Qu'ils s'éloignent, dit-elle, qu'ils me laissent ! » De vagues images de tortures, de supplices, de tortures nouvelles, défilaient avec une pro-fonde rapidité sous ses paupières si longtemps fermées. Elle songea à la mort comme à une espèce d'entracte tiède où les idées et les souvenirs se reposent des orgies nocturnes que la vie donne à boire aux âmes vives. Elle s'engourdissait dans cette apathie de la vie, et le besoin irrésistible de jouir enfin de leur éveil allait l'emporter sur l'horreur de leur allégresse. Mais la voix du médecin l'arrêta avant qu'elle eût fait un pas vers ce royaume où la mort vient chercher celles qu'elle aime. - Votre sœur reprend ses sens, dit-il à Ludovic, peut-elle entendre ce que je vais vous dire ? - Marguerite!

Puis le doutes se mêlent a ce trouble; elle s'inquiéta: «Est-ce vrai? est-ce véritable ? est-ce la réponse à l'interrogation qui avait échappé à l'interlocuteur ? Mais qui donc?» Elle était incapable de comprendre l'explication de cette parole qui frappait son oreille, et elle cherchait à la rendre plus claire dans ses pensées. C'était l'aveu d'une passion violente, et la réponse d'un grand choc dans son coeur, c'était l'explication du crime, c'était la clef de la nuit qui vient de l'ombre. Elle comprit qu'elle l'avait vu.

M. de Chalusse, n'aimait pas mademoiselle Marguerite, tout au moins, il n'aimait pas le marquis de Malboise. Elle l'aimait, elle l'adorait, et lui seul était le maître de ses jours et de ses nuits. Elle sentait que M. de Chalusse avait été un être incompréhensible pour elle, comme son coeur était inexplicable; elle se demandait s'il ne l'avait pas aimée de son côté. C'était, selon elle, le dernier de ces mystères, et elle s'en étonnait. Elle se le demandait et elle ne savait pas répondre, parce que son coeur l'empêchait d'ouvrir la bouche.

XLV Cette crise fut plus longue que celle qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès. Cette fois ce ne fut pas l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'ef-fet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà profondément atteinte. Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au docteur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement.

LUDOVIC, un moine de l'abbaye de Cluny, a entrepris depuis plusieurs années la rédaction d'une encyclopédie sur la morale chrétienne. Sa matière principale est la morale. Il fait la part belle au christianisme. Ses connaissances en matière religieuse sont toutefois limitées. Aussi, quand on lui demande de choisir entre plusieurs sujets, il ne peut faire la différence entre le bien et le mal.
L'univers est un jeu que chacun jouerait pour son plaisir. A cela s'ajoute le devoir moral. L'univers de Ludovic est celui de la société, mais pas celui de l'individu. Ludovic se sert de l'univers pour sa mission, mais il ne le maîtrise pas. Il a des devoirs à accomplir. Il est contraint de jouer le jeu. Il ne peut pas le contrôler.

Elle ne pouvait plus faire un pas de plus, ni même respirer librement, tant elle se sentait oppressée par le poids de cette énorme chaîne de pierre qui la retenait, et par ces milliers d'yeux qui la scrutaient et la suivaient de leurs regards perçants. Le bruit de la voix de Ludovic était comme un fracas continuel, et, de temps à autre, une exclamation ou un cri, dont la nature était inconnue, venait frapper sa ouïe. Ce ne fut que dans le silence de la nuit, quand tout était immobile autour d'elle, qu'elle put se remémorer les conseils du docteur et se rappeler ce qu'il lui avait dit sur les causes de cette maladie et ses résultats probables. Ce serait un miracle si elle était guérie, si elle parvenait à retrouver la santé. Mais si elle mourait, elle avait une place à prendre au purgatoire, et cette place était assurée. Elle se le rappelait bien. Il ne s'agissait plus, à présent, que du moment où elle passerait les portes du temple et sortirait en gloire. L'entrée de la ville et de la grande salle du tribunal eut pour elle comme une délivrance. La salle était immense, et éclairée d'un vaste lustre à gaz. De grandes fenêtres laissaient pénétrer la lumière et la clarté du jour dans le lieu. Quelques personnes étaient rassemblées autour de l'autel, où la Vierge allait être adorée. Des chants sacrés chantaient à pleins poumons, et les plus grands applaudissements de l'assemblée se firent entendre lorsque le maître des cérémonies prononça les mots :
« Sainte Vierge, mère de Dieu, dont la puissance opère mille miracles, écoute les supplications de ceux qui viennent à ton secours en cette douloureuse épreuve, et délivre-nous des forces du démon. O Vierge, écoute, et délivre-nous. » Et le peuple entonna un chant qui, depuis, a été conservé dans les annales du village. Le maître des cérémonies ayant terminé son éloge, et ayant pris place en tête de l'autel, après avoir fait une profonde genouillère à genoux et un baiser sur la main de la sainte, qui paraissait assise en ce moment sur un trône royal d'or, entouré de fleurs et de rayons lumineux, le juge et les avocats furent priés de s'agenouiller. Les jurés furent priés également de s'assoir et de fermer les yeux. La lumière du jour disparut; les cierges à

La nuit, il n'osait pas aller à son chevet. Sa présence éveillait dans son esprit de vagues images d'une situation dont il était incapable de décrire la nature exacte. Mais son anxiété allait en augmentant, et le médecin ne tardait pas à prendre la résolution d'en finir. Il se disposait à écrire à sa mère pour lui en faire part, quand il entendit une voix qu'il reconnut tout de suite et qui, à son grand étonnement, se trouvait dans le cabinet où il était en train de faire une opération.

XXXV This crisis was longer than the one that had preceded it, and there was a period of despair in the doctor's mind.

The word ""céda"" is wrong because it doesn't follow the rules of the French language (which I am speaking).
So, how should the corrected text look like?

You are almost there.

291 CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. XXXV
Ludovic avait été dans la rue à côté du docteur. La fenêtre était ouverte sur une place très éclairée. Ludovic regardait les gens qui dansaient sur une des places voisines. Un vent léger et pur soufflait de la mer. Le jeune homme avait entendu Marguerite dire à propos du mal qui avait tué le docteur : --J'ai vu ce qui ne va pas, et la maladie est encore plus grave que je pensais. J'ai vu le mal dont souffre cet enfant, et le mal dont souffre le docteur. Cette nuit, je lui ai fait dire ses prières à l'église. La messe avait été dite dans la chapelle des lépreux. Marguerite a prié avec lui, et les deux hommes ont passé le reste de la nuit ensemble à l'église. Le docteur, assis sur un banc, à côté de Marguerite, le visage fermé, avait l'œil ouvert. Il regardait, mais il ne voyait plus. Il avait beau regarder, il ne voyait pas. Il avait beau voir, il ne voyait pas. Marguerite ne pouvait plus parler et pourtant elle avait entendu parler de l'enfant qui s'était évanoui. Elle n'avait pas parlé à Ludovic, il y avait longtemps déjà qu'il ne l'avait plus vue. Elle avait demandé au docteur de prier pour l'enfant et, sans parler de son mari, elle avait prié avec lui à l'église. Elle avait dit que, si l'enfant avait vécu, le docteur aurait sauvé l'enfant. Elle avait demandé au docteur de prier pour son mari, et elle l'avait prié pour lui. Marguerite avait dit, avec le cœur brisé, que le docteur, s'il l'avait vu, aurait trouvé le moyen de le guérir. Elle avait dit : --Et toi, si tu l'avais vu ? Et elle avait fini sa prière en disant : --Si tu l'avais vu ! - Mais Marguerite n'osait plus penser à cet enfant. Le docteur était mort. Le docteur était mort. Et tout ce qui le touchait était mort avec lui. Le docteur et l'enfant. La douleur de Marguerite et le désespoir de Ludovic. Une vie qu'ils auraient dû sauver, mais qui ne l'avait pas été. Ils avaient été trop occupés par leur amour pour s'occuper de l'enfant qu'ils auraient dû aimer. Elle avait vu, dans le silence de l'église, le docteur et l'enfant. Elle avait vu le docteur et l'enfant et elle savait ce qu'il devait être dit à l'enfant dans l'église. Elle savait tout. L'enfant aurait dû mourir, et il était vivant. Elle savait, quand l'enfant avait perdu connaissance, ce qu'il fallait faire pour le sauver.

291 CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. XXXVI
Ludovic, le docteur qui avait suivi une cure de la jeunesse, n'avait point voulu perdre le temps et, dans ce moment, il avait trouvé un moyen de prendre le soin de lui, le plaçant au sein de sa chambre.
Ce fut alors qu'il vit venir la petite fille, qui, tout d'une voix douce et calme, avait adressé une salutation aux parents, et en même temps une de ses mains se serrait autour de la sienne.

Ludovic se pencha et, dans la hâte qui lui avait suivi, lui saisit la main droite, la ramena à la main gauche, et la posa sur la tête de sa soeur.
L'autocar s'arrêta devant la maison de la mère, et, se levant, il entra. Les autres voitures ne se trouvaient pas au milieu du boulevard. Il alla prendre une chambre, et, entrant dans le jardin, il fut surpris de voir Marguerite, qui lui avait envoyé une longue, mince et gracieuse phrase, qui commençait par une salutation.

Une longue voix se fit entendre à partir de la fenêtre, qui se trouvait, du côté du jardin, près du poulailler, comme s'il était en train de se prosterner.
Ludovic, qui s'était levé pour entrer, vit que le soleil brillait dans la chambre, et qu'il était impossible de le regarder.

Elle le regarda en silence, puis, s'étant approchée un peu, elle le saisit par la main, et, l'ouvrant, il vit qu'il était assis sur une chaise et que sa femme, assise sur une autre chaise, l'avait regardé en silence.
Ludovic s'était mis à regarder la femme assise près de lui, qui, d'une voix douce et calme, lui avait adressé une salutation. Elle avait l'air de savoir que cette salutation lui faisait sentir bien qu'elle allait lui en parler.

Elle le regardait de nouveau et se demanda si cette femme avait quelque intérêt à lui adresser une salutation. Elle avait l'air très bonne, et elle voulait lui rendre un tour.

2 « Il n'y a pas lieu de chercher dans cet écrit de philosophe, on pourrait y trouver un peu de morale et quelque chose qui se rapprocherait de l'éthique. Mais il y a aussi dans cet écrit quelque chose qui s'apparente à la logique et à la rhétorique, que le lecteur doit rechercher. » 3 Rabelais, Gargantua, livre V, chapitre 13.
3 tre comme s'il se demandait pourquoi la jeune fille avait voulu venir à sa porte. Alors, il remarqua que le visage de la jeune fille était changé de manière significative, qu'elle ne semblait plus sourire. Sa figure était plus grave, comme la nuit tombe plus tôt et plus sombre. Il prit son sac, le regarda longuement et le plaça dans son dos. Il sortit et la suivit jusqu'à l'entrée de sa chambre. Là il entra et la prit par la main, l'amenant avec lui jusqu'au bout de la pièce. Cette fois-ci, elle ne poussa pas un cri. Il sentit que la jeune fille était différente et cela ne le surprenait plus. Elle avait un air abattu. Il s'agenouilla à côté d'elle et posa sa main sur son épaule. Mais cette fois-ci, il ne ressentit pas de chaleur. Il la regarda et la vit pâle, silencieuse, presque muette. Elle semblait avoir la gorge nouée. Il ne put dire s'il fallait en faire quelque chose, car rien ne pouvait lui venir à l'esprit. Il la laissa en son état et se retourna pour aller voir un autre patient dans la chambre d'à côté. Là il entendit une voix douce et tendre qui l'appelait.",BLOOM-3B,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,0.9830508474576272,0.2578947368421053,-0.7376588021778584,80-99%,0.9921480650588896,0.2663776493256262,-0.7315142177797674,99-100%,-0.7345865099788129,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

D'autres débats en faveur de cette rechute de Marguerite

Sauf que je suis très équipe de la police, c'est leurs enfants que je t'aime. Elle aurait bien eu une dizaine de ces débats, soit qu'elle a fait un temps. Aujourd'hui la ministre de la Défense, et l'auteur de la liste de l'organisation ""Dans la jeune fille, des deux fois par jour"", a décidé de se lancer avec la police.

« Je n'ai jamais demandé ce que je suis toujours à leur pâtissage, je ne pense pas si tu ne sois pas témoigné », estime à une décision qui les a été confirmée par les police, d'autres établissements qui ont remis sur l'appareil des deux sondages de la ministre de la Défense.

M. Marguerite, qui a déjà été vite à l'époque de la réputation de l'Université de Montréal, a dû rencontrer ceux qui lui ont souvent reçu deux dizaines de pages d'affaires. Il a déjà eu des études sur son traitement par ailleurs.

Deux débats en faveur de la rechute de Marguerite, qui n'avait pas été fait par la ministre de la Défense

Déclinaires de César de Levesque, à Paris, ont été lui aussi égaux sur ce dossier, et la ministre d'Economie et de la Défense a annoncé qu'elle a fait la déclinaire.

« Il est gagnant de voir un moyen d'apparition sur ce dossier, alors qu'on va parler avec ce dossier, ça n'a pas pu en réaliser des informations sur leurs danss, on n'aurait que des gens qui aideraient leur résultat. Ça me semble plus tard. C'est tout pour tout le monde », a fait valoir M. Levesque, qui a demandé à la police de « vous répondre à ce dossier qu'on puisse être le même juge d'organisation, dans lequel vous êtes à voir dans nos répercussions et des réservations de l'hôpital. »

Par ailleurs, M. Marguerite a dû décliné sur ce dossier avec les policiers. « Mais si je ne vais pas en retransmettre ce dossier, je n'ai jamais demandé ce que je suis toujours à le",OPT-350M,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,0.9830508474576272,0.2614840989399293,-0.7340075545266236,80-99%,0.9921480650588896,0.2489200863930885,-0.7491099411877462,99-100%,-0.7415587478571849,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

This crisis was longer than the one that preceded it, and there was a moment when the doctor was despondent of success. This was no longer the action of poison which was to be dreaded, but the psychic shock to the organism already weakened by the preceding strain. Ludovic accused and besought, he repented and protested, he turned away from the child's room in order to spare it again the consequences of his treatment. He demanded pardon from the doctor for not having done better, and offered to leave the room so as not to endanger again the efficacy of his treatment. But the doctor had thought, and this time his opinion was altogether opposed. - No, no, he said, stay! - But if I commit still any imprudence? - Stay, for heaven's sake, the illness is over. Your presence brought on a crisis, your absence an air of relaxation. I did not know this child, it is a steel head. You must be there when she recovers her senses. Stay. - I obeyed then. - And the heavens may help you, Ludovic, when the right time comes. This young girl has at the heart of her an infection which I cannot cure and that the Faculty in Body would not cure it is the disgust of life. But try, and I will bring my science before yours. You love her? - If I love her, yes, 1 And then, with a sigh, he added:
If I love her.
But if she loves me I shall succeed.

The text of the first paragraph has a missing word ""was"", which makes it sound like an unfinished sentence. This is because ""was"" has a ""was"" in the middle and the text looks like this (I have circled the ""was"").

The missing word ""if"" is circled in red and the correct replacement word is circled in black.

The text of the second paragraph contains two sentences that are separated by ""and"". The original version of the sentence contained ""was"", which makes the original text look like this.

XX le maire, stupeur des Lydiens du moment comme ils Fcnt des jeunes gens de Bordeaux de nos rtemps s’admirons de l’et de son exaltation qu","The source of the error is unknown. The text may not represent a genuine historical document, as its language and style (poor French reminiscent of a caricature) do not consistently resembles a real medieval text (real texts from that time distinguish themselves by the orthographic forms of ""i"" and ""s"" used when they are not silent, such as in >cueillies contre nature vs. cueillies ('[that which is] gathered [from'] against [nature""]); it is also unlikely that a scribe would have made so many spelling mistakes. Some errors may have been introduced when the text was automatically processed by a computer (OCR). It leads to a hypothesis: can we easily test whether the text above is a systematically modified version of a real text, or are its most obvious errors just parodies?

We want to test the hypothesis in a simple way. A natural idea is to grab a few diplomas from the same age and see how their text looks (""corpus test""). For example, the Dijon corpus4 has about 300 diplomas dating from 1410 to 1450 and a few diplomas are not too long so that we can easily compare with the ""rosaries text"", filled with diplomas of the same kind, but of our time (about 2000 diplomas).

Text-mining example: diplomas

We use a Python script to get the words, along with their frequencies (""essentially dumb"" data visualization is often done using pandas and matplotlib). The red points corresponding to each text total up to the frequencies we observed above.

The X-axis is the number of words in a text, and the Y-axis with the red curves correspond to the frequency for four corpora: one with diplomas of Dijon, one of Tessin, one with diplomas of the 22nd century, and this corpus that we want to compare to the medianized data. We can see some differences such as squares (whose size is set by the frequency of a word) appearing at the bottom (corresponding to rare words) and demoted spikes at the top (referentials).

Our corpus is clearly different, less bright, less dense and less structured. The rare words are rarely used in the sentences where they occur, unlike in diplomas of 1300.

But this picture is misleading because it only shows the set of the most frequent words, rather than their syntactic distribution. It gives only part of the information to identify or reject systematic modification of the text. We can see a better picture by comparing the 6,000 most frequent words in the ""rosaries text"" and their syntactic usage:

We reordered the horizontal axis so that the most frequent words are at the bottom (the very first in this figure). The earlier account was a concentrated spike at the top, but here, although some words are still very frequent (with a green line cut to the top) most of the words are used only occasionally (between green and orange) then very often (below orange).

Are these differences sufficient to support the hypothesis that this is a systematically modified text, or can we think of a more plausible explanation for this data? One hypothesis is that the rare words are actually less frequent in accordance to the 14th century language, or related to peculiar and abundant uses in the 14th century in comparison to our time and even the 21st century (among",GPT-3,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,0.9830508474576272,0.2382978723404255,-0.757593543653705,80-99%,0.9921480650588896,0.2581750233572096,-0.7397817599514388,99-100%,-0.7486876518025719,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

XXXV C'est donc dans cette atmosphère, au cours d'un séjour bien ordonné, que Marguerite de Navarre revint dans la chambre et y trouva Pierre d'Auvergne qui lui rendit visite. Son arrivée en France était précédée d'une visite à Paris, qui a beaucoup marqué la relation de deux personnes qui n'avaient pas eu d'autres contacts de la vie que ceux qui les avaient accompagnées de France. On dit qu'elles étaient dans une sorte de liaison entre esprit et corps. On ne sait si elle s'entendait bien avec ce qui avait suivi, mais, de toute façon, une amitié était impossible à exprimer, en raison du secret qui les liait. Le souvenir de ces visites est bien ancré dans la mémoire des hommes qui ont reçu ce don de connaître un visage inconnu, de connaître une personne qui, tout en n'étant pas connue, est, en même temps, une personne dont on ne connaît pas toujours la cause, ou son sens. Cette rencontre avec le corps, ce qui est, par essence, la rencontre du moi, les amène à une certaine inquiétude. Pour Marguerite, elle n'avait pas encore vu le médecin qui avait prescrit ces mesures, et la lecture des journaux le rassurait. Elle n'avait donc pas de moyen de connaître son médecin, et l'on ne savait pas pourquoi il lui a laissé la porte ouverte. Elle se sentira peut-être déçue du médecin. Elle a bien aimé son médecin, et il lui a dit qu'il s'était senti moins malade. Elle a parlé avec un certain regret de ne pas être arrivée au moment convenable, et de la négligence de cette personne. Elle a trouvé la vérité en ces mots qui, dans le journal, elle a trouvé, dans ces nouvelles de son médecin, une preuve irréfutable de sa foi en la médecine: «Elle a fait le choix de vivre, de choisir son avenir. Elle a dit qu'il la ferait, mais qu'elle ne voulait pas être un mauvais médecin. Elle a dit que les médecins se ressemblent, que chacun de ses conseils ne peut s'appliquer qu'à une partie de sa vie. Elle a pensé aussi au docteur qui avait sauvé la vie à une femme qui avait perdu la vie. Il avait sauvé la vie à sa femme, mais elle l'avait déjà perdue.

Je n'ai plus la force de lui en-voyer une simple lettre, il ne doit pas me voir dans ces plaies. Le docteur comprit le secret de cette volonté que rien ne pouvait vaincre, et, tout en l'écoutant avec une bienveillance parfaite, il eut une grimace, que Marguerite interpréta en ces termes : - Je lui ai dit que je l'aimais. Ah ! il ne m'a pas crue, il ne m'a pas écoutée, il n'a pas voulu entendre ce qu'avait à lui dire mon âme. Tout ceci, le docteur ne pouvait le dire à Ludovic. Il ne s'en trouvait pas digne, car il en sentait la nécessité pour Marguerite, et, en dehors de cela, il était jaloux de cet amour qui venait d'éclater entre ces deux êtres si différents.

Mais ne le voyez plus. - Je ne puis pas rester loin de lui. - Mais restez près de moi, j'irai moi-même le voir.

Et Marguerite s'éloigna, toute confuse, comme pour s'éloigner aussi de son âme. - Ah ! pensa Ludovic, que ce fut long, que je fus patient, mais que n'ai-je pas souffert pour elle! Ah! je l'avais laissée vivre dans les ténèbres, je l'avais laissée sans consolation, je l'avais laissée tout au plus écouter la musique dans sa chambre, et elle avait tant souffert, et tant pleuré, que, si je l'avais laissée seule, je la perdais peut-être pour jamais. - Et le docteur resta",BLOOM-7.1B,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,0.9830508474576272,0.1833333333333333,-0.8135057471264368,80-99%,0.9921480650588896,0.2466216216216216,-0.751426596183521,99-100%,-0.7824661716549789,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

290 CE QUE L'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE. XXXV

Cette crise fut plus longue que celle qui avait précédé, et il y eut un moment où le médecin désespéra du succès. Ce n'était plus l'action du poison qui était à craindre, mais l'effet de cette secousse morale sur une organisation déjà profondément atteinte.

Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au docteur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement.

Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait. Votre présence a amené une crise, votre absence en amènerait une autre, plus fâcheuse encore. Je ne connaissais pas cette enfant, c'est une tête de fer. Il faut que vous soyez là, quand elle reprendra ses sens. Restez.

- J'obéis alors.

- Et que le ciel vous inspire, Ludovic, quand le moment sera venu. Cette jeune fille a au cœur une plaie dont je ne puis la guérir et que la Faculté en corps ne guérirait pas : c'est le dégoût de la vie. Tâchez d'en venir à bout et j'inclinerai ma science devant la vôtre. L'aimez-vous?

Je suis allé dans un quartier de la rue qui se nomme « Raspail », où l'on aime lire et crier, seuls et ensemble.

A:

This is a good exercise, and one that I would suggest to all of my students.
The way you used the space to mark up the text is wrong. Your indentation is inconsistent (and, in the third segment, all indented). When using a mark-up to correct an error, the indentation should be consistent. I have seen this error made quite a few times. I would suggest putting each block of text in a separate paragraph and then using different spaces in each",""" segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

b. Alexandre Dumas fils, Souvenirs de jeunesse ( Paris, 1883), II. 65 n. Viardot writes to Dumas: "" That comes from the anecdote of the ""little stick ""(plantoir). One day Madame Récamier was pregnant, at least so they said, and to avoid all scandal, she gave notice to her mother and to the poor curé who had officiated at her marriage and who still visited her. When the poet Chénier wished to enter, the old woman received him as she would anybody who came by who was not inscribed in front. He said to Dumas: ""Voilà Villot et Villotne, petit plantoir et grand plantoir,"" quoting a passage from their tragedy. The next day all of social life was discussing the joke at Madame Récamier s expense.""

Si on y a d'amour, on n'a pas de vie, on ne veut pas pas lui ou leur être vieux.

Pour faire des hommes, tous les femmes et tous les menaces, de manière avec les autres, on ne nous laissera pas leur choix.

La veuve, la pensionnaire, s'est mariée depuis long-tems ; mais elle a demeuré mariée sans ménager son époux, lequel a été plusieurs fois conduit à la Bastille.
Elle passe pour avoir de la verve. C'est en vertu de cette réputation qu'elle a obtenu du Ministre d'État le privilège de pouvoir jouer, une fois par an, un seul acte de la Pensionnaire mariée.
La veuve, la pensionnaire, a donc, par une précaution bien judicieuse, donné, en 1800, le privilége de représenter un acte du vaudeville à un certain Monsieur de Lamotte, alors chef de division à la maison d'ordre du palais de l'Élysée.
Ce Monsieur de Lamotte, après avoir remis le privilège à Mme de Launay, la gouvernante de Napoléon, l'a lui-même présenté au premier Consul.
Napoléon a accordé le privilège ; mais il s'est contenté de remettre le manuscrit à Mme de Launay, comme à un simple amusement.
En 1803, l'acte que le Premier Consul a remis à Mme de Launay, avait été représenté à Paris, à la salle Montansier, par MM. Brasseur et Roché.
Ce fut alors que Napoléon fit une distinction. Mme de Launay fit représenter la Pensionnaire mariée par MM. Brasseur et Roché à la salle Montansier, et la donna au ministre de l'Intérieur.
Mme de Launay est devenue veuve, et Mme de Rémusat a pris la place qu'occupait Mme de Launay dans l'intérieur de l'Empereur. Mme de Rémusat, par son esprit, sa grâce et son amabilité, a tout naturellement fait connaître aux personnes qui se trouvaient auprès de l'Empereur, le privilège de représenter un acte du vaudeville à Mme de Launay, et l'acte dont on a parlé était l'acte de la Pensionnaire mariée, comme on le voit par la pièce qui suit, extraite du journal officiel de la salle Montansier.
Paris, 17 janvier 1805.
_La Pensionnaire mariée_ fut jouée à la salle Montansier le 17 janvier 1805, par MM. Brasseur et Roché.
On s'informait curieusement des auteurs de cette pièce.
M. Roché annonça qu'il ne pouvait rien répondre sur ce point, excepté qu'on les chercherait dans la famille de Launay, dans laquelle ils se trouvaient en quelque sorte cachés.
Mais à partir de ce moment, le mystère de cette pièce ne fut plus gardé ; car le nom de MM. Delannoy et Nerole fut annoncé et révélé.
Le ministère de l'Intérieur, auquel la représentation avait été donnée, fit une note à M. Roché, lui ayant demandé son autorisation, pour permettre aux auteurs de la pièce de la faire représenter à tout autre théâtre.
Au mois d'avril de cette année 1805, la pièce fut remise en représentation à l'Arcade.
Elle fut très-souvent remise en représentation et jouée jusqu'en 1809.
M. Delannoy en fut le chef et le maître. Nerole, c'est moi, et mon nom fut annoncé à la salle de l'Arcade, comme celui des auteurs de la Pensionnaire mariée.
Elle a été plusieurs fois remise en représentation, et j'ai continué à la dire.
La réputation que cette pièce a acquise, depuis qu'elle fut donnée à l'Arcade en 1805, a produit la continuation de la Pensionnaire mariée, que nous allons donner ici, sous le titre d'un _Acte de la Pensionnaire mariée_.
La Pensionnaire Mariée
ACTE FINAL
Scène première
La VIEILLE VEUVE, MADAME LA VICOMTESSE DE LIGNY.
La Vieille veuve. — Madame la vicomtesse de Ligny ! Voilà bien la fille d'une pensionnaire, la fille d'une vraie pensionnaire, comme on disait autrefois, qui a été pensionnaire de la reine. Eh ! j'avais une amie, madame, une amie pensionnaire, et sa fille est bien gentille !
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Oui, monsieur. J'ai connu votre ami, la pensionnaire. Elle a bien connu ma mère, qui a été pensionnaire à Chaillot.
La Vieille veuve. — Oui, c'est bien cela ! Madame de Ligny, que vous m'avez rendu bien heureuse, en me donnant votre fille, votre très-chère fille !
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Oui, monsieur, je suis heureuse, je suis très-heureuse de votre amitié, je me réjouis de votre bienveillance ; mais ma fille est bien différente de sa mère. Son caractère n'a rien de celui de sa mère.
La Vieille veuve. — Ah ! que dis-je ?
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Je me suis souvenu, ce matin, que sa mère était pensionnaire à la cour de Louis XV.
La Vieille veuve. — Ah !
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Si vous aviez vu l'amour et la tendresse qu'elle avait pour son roi et son époux !
La Vieille veuve. — Quelquefois il en était à tel point qu'il n'y avait pas un de ses gens, pas un de ses valets qui ne lui eût dit, en se retirant : « Mon Dieu, qu'on le tue !
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Oh !
La Vieille veuve. — Que vous m'aviez bien trompée, à la tête !
La Vieille veuve. — Ah !
La Vieille veuve. — Eh ! monsieur, il est de l'avis de tous les amis de ma fille, qu'elle est aussi vive, aussi gaie, aussi entremetteuse, qu'un mari à qui il n'",LLAMA-2-7B,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,0.9642857142857144,0.1282051282051282,-0.8670465337132004,80-99%,0.9858136300417246,0.2179436284239777,-0.7789200496094244,80-99%,-0.8229832916613125,Negative Improvement,,,,,,80-99%

C'est une découverte en plus en fin de la soirée. Le cœur aussi peut-être le début, auquel on n'a pas de mise. Les prélèvements estiment que les deux étoiles sont déjà désormais très près et les derniers n'ont aucune nouvelle évolution sur les derniers actes.

En fait, ça ne s'est pas la surprise d'un nouvel acte. On est dans ce cœur de ses prélèvements dans un nouvel endroit. En outre, l'ensemble de sa soirée a donc une nouvelle évolution à l'ensemble d'une histoire de la dernière saison. L'ensemble est moins difficile de sauver de ces deux étoiles, mais la cœur se découvre sur ceux qui ont découvert les prélèvements de sauver, de l'ensemble d'une histoire de ses prélèvements.

Le premier nouvel acte est l'ensemble du quatrième. L'ensemble est une histoire de sauver de sauver, mais l'ensemble du quatrième est le plus difficile duquatrième. L'ensemble de la soirée est l'une des prélèvements de sauver de sauver. Ce quatrième est une histoire de sauver de sauver. La cœur est le plus difficile du quatrième. L'ensemble du quatrième est un ancien d'un prélèvement dans lequel il est en partie une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements, et l'ensemble du quatrième est une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements, et l'ensemble du quatrième est un ancien d'un prélèvement dans lequel il est en partie une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements. La cœur est un ancien d'un prélèvement dans lequel il est en partie une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements, et l'ensemble du quatrième est une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements.

Qui est-ce qu'un périphérique de sauver de sauver?
