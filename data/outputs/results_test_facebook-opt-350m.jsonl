With so many conservatives and libertarians and libertarians-for-hire running for president and vice president, there's a real chance that President Obama could have a much harder time winning over the Republican Party's base than Republicans have ever experienced.\n\nOn Thursday, the House Republican Campaign Committee released a list of the names of some of the most important conservative groups that they plan to run on the Republican side in 2012.\n\nAccording to a press release, those groups are:\n\nThe American Conservative Union, a leading national group for conservative Christians.\n\nThe American Freedom Coalition, a group for Christian conservatives.\n\nThe Council for National Policy, a group for conservative Christian conservatives.\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute", "num_generate": 0}

There are some types of mad cow disease, but mad cow is the most commonly used.\n\nHowever, scientists have not yet determined that there is a direct link between mad cow disease and the recent U.S. outbreak of mad cow diarrhea.\n\nThe European Commission says that the use of the word “mad cow” should not be confused with the U.S. and “Mad Cow Disease”.\n\n“Mad cow is not an exact reference, it was not developed in the United States or any other country. It was not made public on this website. It is not a direct reference. In this context, it does not serve the purpose of our position on mad cow disease,” the commission said.\n\nThe commission said that, “Mad cow has no direct connection with the current outbreak of mad cow diarrhea in the United States, which is now in its third week and is characterized by diarrhea with diarrhea on the sides of the stomach, not the stomach and not on the sides of the intestine.”\n\nThe commission", "num_generate": 1}
