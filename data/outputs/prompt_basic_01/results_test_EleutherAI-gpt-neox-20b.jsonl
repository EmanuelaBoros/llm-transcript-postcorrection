There is also no evidence to suggest that BSE can be transmitted to sheep through the feeding of meat and bone meal,\" he said.\n\nArens said the EC has agreed with the German position that there is no justification to make any changes to the way European sheep farmers feed their animals.\n\n\"Until we find out what the full story is about BSE and how it can be transmitted, it is not justified to make any recommendations to consumers to avoid British sheep and lamb.\"\n\nArens said the current advice to consumers is that it is safe to eat British sheep and lamb.\n\n\"We are exercizing all due diligence to ensure that the safety of sheep and lamb remains a priority in our", "num_generate": 0}
