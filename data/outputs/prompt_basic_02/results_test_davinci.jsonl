German consumers, whose demand for British lamb is worth 100 million pounds to the British economy, were advised to eat it rarely, or boil it thoroughly, since the disease might be present even in the waste products of slaughtered animals. Mad cow disease, believed to be transmitted by cattle eating animal remains in abattoirs, has forced the slaughter of thousands of animals in Europe, mostly in Britain. The European Commission spokesman, quoted by Reuters, said it was not clear how Mad Cow dsase could be transmitted to sheep. Mad Cow disease, known in scientific terms as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) since it attacks the brain and central nervous system, was first recognized in the late 1980s in Britain. It has since killed more than 40 people in that country. - Thomas Urbina (Reuters), January 10, 2000", "num_generate": 0}
