Britain's Department of the Environment, which is responsible for testing lambs, said that since it began testing in the spring, one lamb out of 107 tested had the B.S.E. prion. Mrs. Shields said the commission had advised Britain that it must increase the number of lambs tested. The Department of the Environment has said that testing in Scotland and Ireland, where the first B.S.E. outbreaks have been found, should begin next week, but Mrs. Shields said the commission believed testing could begin immediately. A total of 48 sheep so far have been found to have the B.S.E. prion. Tests are being conducted to find out whether the prion is transmitted to other animals. Britain announced a month ago that it was testing 33,000 sheep and a similar number of sheep from neighboring countries. But since B.S.E. was first identified in sheep in March, no cases have been found in sheep in Britain. Mrs. Shields said the commission \"does not accept the suggestion that British sheep are somehow less clean than sheep elsewhere in Europe,\" adding that British farmers were also subject to rules to protect consumers. \"We are not in the business of saying don't buy British lamb,\" she said. \"We want European consumers to", "num_generate": 0}
