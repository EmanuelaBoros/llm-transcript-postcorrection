In addition, the passages that the system most frequently fails to recognize are those that are the least predictable, i.e. the ones containing proper names, abbreviations, acronyms, and so on,\" according to a study on the subject.\n\nThe quality of the results depends on the quality of the input text, as well as on its characteristics of the source text. Hence, it is not surprising that the quality of results improves with the amount of training data.\n\nIn the following table, a comparison of three optical character recognition engines is shown using the FAME test set. The table shows the results for the three engines over a training set of 885 pages from the FAME test set, and a test set of the remaining 42 pages.\n\nThe two engines that were developed by the same group (Tesseract and ABBYY) are based on similar technology and can be expected to give similar results. The two engines that were developed in different groups (CuneiForm and GOCR) are based on different technologies, and can be expected to give different results. Hence, the results of both engines (CuneiForm and GOCR) are merged, and the results are compared to Tesseract and ABBYY.\n\nRegarding the results, it is important to note that it is the results over the training set that are compared, and not the results over the test set. Hence, the results that are shown in the table are results over a set of pages that are much easier to recognize than the remaining pages in the FAME test set.\n\nThe following table shows the results of the Tesseract engine using the same approach as in the previous table.\n\nThe table shows that Tesseract is much better than the other engines on recognizing characters that are distorted in various ways. For example, Tesseract recognizes 99.4% of the characters in the \"noisy\" sample, while the other engines only recognize between 96.6% and 98.8%. In the \"blur\" sample, Tesseract recognizes 99% of the characters, while the other engines only recognize between 97.5% and"}

One disadvantage is the difficulty in predicting which words are likely to be misspelled based on their morphological or syntactic context. An approach that targets words based on their syntactic context can spell correct words such as \"read\" and \"lead\" (verb), but will fail to correct the misspelling of \"lead\" (noun).\n\nAnother problem with context-based methods is that they are limited by the context from which they are derived. For instance, a context-based spelling corrector trained on the Wall Street Journal Corpus would probably do a poor job at spelling corrections for the New York Times.\n\nA language model (LM) can be used to provide a probabilistic model for how words are spelled. The language model is typically based on a set of words that have been observed in a corpus. Words that are not found in the corpus are usually given a zero probability of being spelled in a particular way. An approach that uses a language model is described in.\n\nAnother approach to spelling correction uses a statistical machine translation model. This approach is described in and.\n\nA third approach is based on a classifier that is trained on a large set of words, using the concept of decision trees. The output of the classifier is a list of candidate corrections, ranked by the probability that each candidate is valid. The methods described in and are examples of this approach.\n\n"}
