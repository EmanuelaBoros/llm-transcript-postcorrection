Pourtant le mari venait régulièrement le voir. La femme de ce couple commençait à avoir de la vieillesse. Son mari, qui ne pouvait être en état de se livrer à la conversation, allait parfois à sa maison. Il venait souvent le voir et lui disait : « J'ai une femme, tu sais, qui, en dépit de tout, m'a toujours donné un petit coup de main ». Mais ce n'était pas du tout le cas. Il lui donnait de la peine, et, pendant ses promenades, il allait souvent le voir, se plaignant de la vieillesse, en se lamentant. La femme lui faisait un mal terrible au ventre, au cou, à la poitrine et aux jambes, qui était à l'origine d'un profond mal de tête. « Ah ! je viens d'aller le voir ! » lui dit-il. Il lui demanda un petit coup de main. Il lui tendit sa main et il lui dit : « Ne me touche pas, je suis faible. Je te le demande ! » Et il la toucha, mais elle ne le tenait pas. Puis il en alla de son tour à la maison. Le lendemain, il lui demanda de le conduire chez lui, mais il n'en vint pas et ne le voulut pas. Il avait dit à sa femme qu'il se trouvait dans la maison voisine. Et il alla lui chercher. La femme se trouvait à genoux devant lui, mais, d'un bond de sa chaise, elle se tut. Comme elle se tut, le vieux lui dit : « Il n'a pas de femme ? » La femme ne le voulut pas. Et il ajouta : « Que fais-tu ? » Et elle dit : « Je meurs, je meurs, de peur de ce vieux, qui me trahit et me force à vivre dans cette maison de campagne.

His son had been convicted of a crime, and had been condemned to a life sentence. The sentence was in the hands of Lord Condor, and his wife was taken prisoner in the Castle of Eton. Van dermast was a man who had been sent by Van dermast to England, and had been convicted of a crime, and a sentence had been pronounced upon him. When he had expired, Van dermast sent a letter to the Queen in which he declared himself the cause of the murder. The Queen, after consulting with the judges of the court, ordered him to be sent to England and sent his wife to be executed, but Van dermast had been given a liberty in the name of God, and he therefore was not to be executed. Van dermast returned to Holland and was sent into the Tower of St. James. During the day he slept in a room with a bed at his side, and during the night he was carried up and down stairs. The Queen, having heard of the crime, ordered that Van dermast should be sent to England and sent her to be executed, and she was executed at the Tower of St. James.\n\nAn example of wrong spelling:\n\nIncorrect text: The Englishman was a man of a certain class, called the ‘hunters’, and he had fought in the field with a Spanish cavalry troop. The Spanish troops, when they saw him, shot down him, and he fell in a ditch. The horse of the Englishman, which he had brought with him, struck the ditch, and fell, with all the gallantry of the horse that the countrymen have used against their enemies.\nIn this sentence, the incorrect form was ‘the horse’.</s>"}}
