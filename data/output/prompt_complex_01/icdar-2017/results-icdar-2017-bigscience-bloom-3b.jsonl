Melchior was that gift he stood out of the people and did not give up until it did. It was he that took him. We had come face to face with enemies, we were going to part the best of friends. Not because there was any substance in this or a danger to you, but this good looking man had thrown some life into our inner space and made us laugh with him. We were glad of this in return, and forgetting the little troubles that he had caused me, his impertinences, his fading airs, his pipes, his cravats and his beard. He had to be seen, or he lost his good looks. From far away he saw himself out of reach and lost his advantage. His tact was perfect from the start, but in the end I had to take him back. We were already at the top when he left. He was leaving me too, and he was looking down at me so closely that I had to lift up my head. The stairs were starting to descend, and before I knew it, he was already on the stairs. He was still apologizing and I promised that I wouldn't take him back. I had already been waiting for him, and he was already on the stairs when my candle went out. Did he? Was he the want? I have never known, but at that moment I felt a pull at my waist and suddenly felt a hug from both my sides. The mystery was already growing, between Melchior and me, I was feeling a kind of complicity. I was outraged for the way he was acting, I promised myself I wouldn't get involved with this any more and kept that promise. Soon the mystery began to grow, between Melchior and me, and already the otherness was feeling its way inside me.</s>"}}

Melchior was that gift he stood out of the people and did not give up until it did. It was he that took him. We had come face to face with enemies, we were going to part the best of friends. Not because there was any substance in this or a danger to you, but this good looking man had thrown some life into our inner space and made us laugh with him. We were glad of this in return, and forgetting the little troubles that he had caused me, his impertinences, his fading airs, his pipes, his cravats and his beard. He had to be seen, or he lost his good looks. From far away he saw himself out of reach and lost his advantage. His tact was perfect from the start, but in the end I had to take him back. We were already at the top when he left. He was leaving me too, and he was looking down at me so closely that I had to lift up my head. The stairs were starting to descend, and before I knew it, he was already on the stairs. He was still apologizing and I promised that I wouldn't take him back. I had already been waiting for him, and he was already on the stairs when my candle went out. Did he? Was he the want? I have never known, but at that moment I felt a pull at my waist and suddenly felt a hug from both my sides. The mystery was already growing, between Melchior and me, I was feeling a kind of complicity. I was outraged for the way he was acting, I promised myself I wouldn't get involved with this any more and kept that promise. Soon the mystery began to grow, between Melchior and me, and already the otherness was feeling its way inside me.</s>"}}

So, you must write how Friere Rush grymed the waggon, because you are getting the error because your \"how\" clause is missing. \nSecondly, the word cbeare is an ellipsis in this sentence, because you are getting the error because your \"who\" clause is missing. \nThe word grymed is also a typo. The word grymed is an ellipsis. The word grymed is an ellipsis and the word grymed is an ellipsis.\n\nThirdly, a long, boring, pointless explanation that you won't actually get. If you had a list of all the possible typos and errors that I might have missed, you would be in trouble. If you have a list of all the typos that I could possibly have missed, then the list would be long. I can't think of many typos that would be on that list, because I am just an inexperienced editor.
