Ludovic, you were going to come to my assistance, and I was to have waited on the threshold to receive you! Some more moments and you would have found me in the arms of my death. We decided, Melchior and I, on our last arrangements. Before the daybreak, and when the door had been opened, he quitted the house. A rendezvous had been fixed, and I was to go and meet him. He passed without being seen, perhaps, the concierge was his accomplice. But I, I remained, during an hour, buried in my regrets and my remorse. -Oh, what were you thinking of me then?

Then, I drew from my finger the ring which I had received from my grandmother and which had so ill preserved my honour. I was no longer worthy to wear it, whether the circumstances turned out as they might or no. I rejoined Melchior, and he was found drunk with his happiness.

We would like to use the OCR to obtain a transcript and, at the same time, use the output to predict whether the article is about a sports match or not. If the OCR output is corrupt and no longer contains any information about the sports match, then the system should still be able to identify the article as a sports match"}}

He passed without being seen, perhaps, the concierge was his accomplice. But I, I remained, during an hour, buried in my regrets and my remorse. -Oh, what were you thinking of me then?

Then, I drew from my finger the ring which I had received from my grandmother and which had so ill preserved my honour. I was no longer worthy to wear it, whether the circumstances turned out as they might or no. I rejoined Melchior, and he was found drunk with his happiness.
