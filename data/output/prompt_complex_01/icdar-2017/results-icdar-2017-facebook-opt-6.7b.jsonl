Melchior avait ce don il s'em-parait des gens et ne lâchait prise que lorsque cela lui con venait. Ce fut de lui-même qu'il prit congé. Nous nous étions abordés en ennemis nous allions nous quitter les meilleurs amis du monde. Non pas qu'il y eut là-dedans quelque chose de sérieux ni de dangereux pour vous mais ce bon vivant avait jeté sur notre intérieur un peu de vie et de mouvement il avait fait rire ma grand'mère, il l'avait tenue éveillée sans effort et heureuse de cette distraction. Je lui savais gré de cela, et en retour j'oubliai complétement les petits ennuis qu'il m'avait autrefois causés, ses impertinences, ses airs évaporés, ses pipes, ses cravates et sa barbe. Il gagnait à être vu de près et y reprenait tous ses avantages. De toute la soirée, il ne lui échappa rien qui pût blesser mes oreilles, ni contrarier la révolution qui s'opérait en moi. Il se contint, il s'observa d'une manière parfaite jusqu'au moment où il nous quitta. J'étais loin de m'attendre à la surprise qu'il me ména-geait. Il s'était levé et avait salué la grand'mère, qui lui avait tendu la main très-affectueusement. De mon côté, j'avais pris le flambeau pour le reconduire. Il était tard les étages supérieurs étaient déjà dans les ténèbres, et à moins de l'exposer à une chute, il me fallait le raccompagner le long des degrés. Lui pourtant se confondait en excuses et me sup-pliait à chaque marche de ne pas aller plus loin. Enfin je cédai, et me disposai à l'abandonner.

The days passed, and we had to make a choice between opposing our wishes, and losing each other in the storm of events. Yet still more unfortunate was it that we should come to an agreement, and then be severed by one who might have been the true friend of our hearts, and the preserver of our honor, rather than the one we had to deal with. At last we had to give in to fate. And when the door was opened, Melchior left the house. A rendezvous had been fixed for us, and I must go to meet him. He had passed without being noticed by anybody, for the house-keeper was perhaps his accomplice. As for me, I remained for an hour longer buried in my grief and regrets, while Melchior was rejoicing in his happiness. - Then, Ludovic, the remembrance of all your kindness returned to me then and there, and I found myself quite ungrateful, quite cruel and very dejected. - What have you thought of me?

The grand-chef, you take the secteur H, dangerous for the marmites, especially at the Bois Equerre you follow the central boyau Boscary until you reach the boyau Boscary, where you will find the commandant's post. Pay careful attention to the other positions, as well, as to the artillery positions. The night was quite calm, without moon and clear darkness on the trunks of the trees across the river. The shots in the sky scattered their light by moments with a graceful grace. The battery guns fired one after another, filling the horizon with a blaze of graceful radiance. The team separated into two. Then, at the file, the new recruits went the route nearest the trees to avoid the fallen shells which splattered against the trunks on the other side of the river. Then he continued his march by treading lightly, in search to find the signboard to indicate the battalion. He didn't take a diversion to find the signal, as it is necessary to arrive five hundred meters from the post before turning it. Oh, the beautiful blue! - Come on, let's go move up the movement, ordered Legrand impatiently, leaving Duruy, who entered his boyau, behind him. We still have one more leg of the course! Don't turn around, let's go on! Without turning around, he pressed on his way, impatiently waiting for the battalion to pass. He didn't turn back, he pressed on, with his head looking around, for the signboard indicating the battalion's post. Without taking a diversion he looked for it, so that he would find it before it was too late. He looked around and he looked around to find it. Then he looked around and he looked around to find it.

Il faut si. peu de chose pour arrêter une confidence sur les lèvres, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de s'accuser d'un tort et de se mettre à la merci d'autrui ! On s'empare alors du premier prétexte, le plus futile, le plus spécieux on recule, on ajourne, et, dans ces ajournements mêmes, -on puise des mo-tifs pour s'abstenir. C'est ce qui m'arriva, Ludovic. Avant- de vous revoir, j'étais résolue à tout vous dire, et quand je vous revis la confiance me manqua. Il n'y eut là-dedans ni raisonnement, ni calcul mais une force impérieuse et presque indépen-dante de ma volonté. Puis je me payais de défaites. Pourquoi troubler votre sécurité et éveiller vos soupçons? La chose en valait-elle la peine? Cet homme, en venant chez moi, avait obéi à un caprice probablement il n'y reviendrait plus. Et s'il revenait, quoi de plus aisé que de le remettre à sa place et de faire justice de ses airs cavaliers ? Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat, .comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre deux hommes en présence et jusqu'aux prises pour un si léger motif? Voilà à quelles impressions je cédai sans m'en rendre bien compte, ni pénétrer trop avant dans mon coeur Peut-être, hélas ! en interrogeant mieux ce coeur, aurais-je trouvé le dernier mot de ces réticences.
