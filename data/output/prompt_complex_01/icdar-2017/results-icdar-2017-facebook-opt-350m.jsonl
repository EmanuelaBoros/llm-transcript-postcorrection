A l'initiative du ministère des Affaires étrangères de la Ville de Paris, le ministère des Affaires étrangères de la ville a demandé au Parlement de réaliser un soutien à ce nouveau gouvernement de réaliser l'autorité des conditions du gouvernement dans lequel le gouvernement de l'éducation démissionnera, pour un moment, à la ville de Paris, l'autorité de la ville des deux pays, duquel ils sont le plus précisés et au lieu de faire passer la situation, ils se prévenent à un seul bilan. Ce sont des entreprises et de nombreux organisations de tous ceux qui ont le plus à faire rendre le gouvernement dans leurs bâtons. La légitimité, l'électorat, des enfants qui ont été déplacés en décembre 2015 et des députés étrangères, les écologistes ou les sociologists, les bienveillants, le professeur à l'éducation, des médecins, des femmes et de négociateurs, les personnes que nous avons pu les respecter, les moyens que nous avons pu avoir pour écouter à la ville et à l'éducation des pays de la Ville de Paris.

Il s'agit d'une manière d'enverger un gouvernement qui n'en pouvait pas aider à aider les deux pays à réagir. Il n'y a pas de résultat, dans tout le monde. J'ai toujours dit, pourquoi nous allons être fonctionnés de plusieurs pays dans l'éducation de la Ville de Paris? C'est de la manière d'évaluer ce soutien, de changer la situation, de refuser d'être remboursés. Il n'y a pas de raison pour s'en rendre au même moment l'autorité de l'Éducation des pays d'Enfants, l'autorité de la ville de Paris, celle de l'éducation des pays d'Enfants. Si je vous leur estime, c'est ce qui m'a besoin d'être demandé dans ce premier contexte. Les réseaux sociaux, du futur, en sont morts.
