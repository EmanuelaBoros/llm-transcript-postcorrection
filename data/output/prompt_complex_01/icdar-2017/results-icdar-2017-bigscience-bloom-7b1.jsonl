Ludovic s'accusait et se désespérait, il rejetait sur lui la responsabilité de cette rechute, et parlait de suivre la jeune fille si elle n'en réchappait pas. Il demandait pardon au doc-teur de n'avoir pas mieux suivi ses conseils et offrait de quitter la chambre afin de ne pas compromettre de nouveau les effets de son traitement. Mais celui-ci avait réfléchi, et cette fois son avis fut tout opposé. - Non, lui dit-il, restez. - Mais si je commets encore quelque imprudence ? - Restez, vous dis-je, le mal est fait.

Quand elle en eut fini avec la terre, Marguerite songea au ciel. Elle s'agenouilla devant le portrait de sa grand'mère et pria avec ferveur. Que fut cette prière? Sans doute un acte de contrition et en même temps un cri de désespoir. Elle prit Dieu à témoin, et, lui montrant l'état de son âme, invoqua sa miséricorde avec un accent éploré. Puis s'adressant à cette aïeule qui avait si saintement vécu et si saintement fini, à sa mère moissonnée avant le temps et qui, son mari mort, avait, elle aussi, manqué de courage, elle les conjura sans doute d'intercéder pour elle et d'obtenir qu'elle fût admise à leurs côtés, dans le séjour des âmes pures ou purifiées par le repentir. Elle leur demanda d'unir leurs prières à la sienne afin d'en augmenter l'effet et d'obtenir ce pardon qui descend d'en haut sur les coeurs humbles et sincères. Quand elle eut mis sa conscience en paix, autant que le permettait l'acte violent auquel elle était résolue, elle monta sur son lit, ajusta ses vêtements de manière à ce que rien n'y pût amener du désordre, s'étendit sur les coussins, et, s'emparant d'une petite fiole qui était à sa portée, elle l'ap-procha de ses lèvres. 1 Quelques minutes après, elle était plongée dans un endormissement profond.</s>"}}

Soudain une tête surgit d'un trou et un bras lui fit signe d'approcher. -C'est nous, fit Régnier, où est le poste? -Y en a pas, répondit une voix, on est tassés dans un gourbi! Couché presque à plat ventre, Régnier se faufila dans l'exca-vation. -C'est maigre, miladious! murmura-t-il, enfin...! Accroupi, ramassé sur lui-même, il établit tant bien que mal sa communication. -Allo! caporal Legrand, c'est vous?... C'est Régnier qui est à l'appareil... Bon... ça marche... Vous dites?... Ah! oui, je crois que le climat n'est pas sain, vu l'humidité. J'ai peur de prendre racine. Je me sens déjà des fourmis dans les jambes... Al-lons, bonne nuit, caporal. -Dites donc, vous n'êtes pas là pour faire la causette, fit brusquement un adjudant, fermez ça une fois pour toutes. Le mieux pour lui était de ne pas répliquer, car il se sentait dans une atmosphère hostile. Les deux soldats qui partaient, sans plus tarder, mirent leurs sacs, s'éloignèrent sur une poignée de main. -Ce n'est pas confortable là dedans, soupira le Méridional assis en tailleur, j'ai des crampes dans les genoux, mais ce qui me console, c'est que je ne paie pas mon loyer! La nuit s'annonçait assez tranquille, fatigués par les atta-ques des jours précédents, les Allemands paraissaient plutôt inquiets qu'agressifs. Insensible et brisé de fatigue.

The best thing for him was not to reply, for he felt himself under a hostile atmosphere. The two soldiers, without further ado, began packing their bags. As they were going away, they shook hands. - This isn't comfortable there, murmured the South-Ary man seated in a slumped position. I feel cramps in my knees, but what relieves me is that I don't pay my rent! The night was rather calm, tired by the attacks of the preceding days, the Germans appeared rather unapproachable than aggressive. Indifferent and broken down, Buchard had fallen asleep.
