It's obvious that the original text is \"The European Commi66ion\" rather than \"The European Commission\". A better solution would be to post an answer with \"The European Commission\" in quotes (and thus leaving a better trace in the original question), but this would involve the OP to edit the question.\n\nComment: @Jeans-Marc: It was a comment, before the edit.  It's not \"obvious\" that the original is \"The European Commi66ion\".

But here I see we should keep a minimum effort! That's interesting! In principle though (in English) I don't see how an answer can go to the right which is the  \"correcst reply\" as if it were right or justified unless it improves all other answers. I think there is one way of thinking how answers are ranked according to effort expended which helps that as a rule.  Anyway, I'm sorry for getting confused. And I'll go", "num_generate": 0}
