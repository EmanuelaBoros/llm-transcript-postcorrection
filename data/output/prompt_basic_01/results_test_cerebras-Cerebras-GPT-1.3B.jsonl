We cannot have more than one reason of the infection and we will be judged before the fact of the disease - the whole EU as well - which means nothing to anyone, including EU citizens!.We have to get these measures right - if we cannot agree then the decision will become a very unpopular choice (as people often think) and only if we get the agreement we cannot change them any later and we cannot ever be the country we deserve to be.\".If they wanted to bring down this price - and as we had to deal with this price of beef, I fear more bad consequences.\"<|endoftext|>", "num_generate": 0}
