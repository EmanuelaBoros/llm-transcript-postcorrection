CORRECTED TEXT:","Derek Fryer was, if not of the most illustrious stock at the time of his death, as a privateer, at least of the most powerful; and that it may have been his power that he was born, he is believed to have been the last person ever to have been so. He was born in the north of England, in the north of Westphalia, in the northern part of his county, of the great county of Swinburne. He was a boy of fourteen. His father was the son of an English merchant of the English port of Oxford; his mother, a daughter of a Scottish merchant; and his mother was a Welshwoman. His mother had come to England from Wales in 1569. A year later she returned, and was given a very large portion of her daughter's estate; so large, that she became the daughter of a Welshman.

had sent, by Van dermast to the Walloon souldier, had to be made of steel, so that hee could not stand any longer upon his knave. Van dermast thus said, ""If I may be sure, that will not cause me much danger, but if it does, I will give a blow to it, and if it does not, I will take a blow to my knave."" Hee saw the wailings of many who had heard the wailings of many who had heard the wailings of many who had heard the wailings of many, and then said, ""This is a strange game to be playing with me, my good sir, but if I fail, and I will have my knave, so it will not do to fail. If I fail, you will never have him."" Van dermast thus spoke to Fryer Bacon, and Fryer Bacon knew him by this action, and therefore had a great respect for this man's intelligence, and was much impressed with his good deed. Van dermast thus said, ""I do hope you will make me, as a good man, a great soldier. But as a soldier I am sure, I will not do you harm. As a good man, I will do you good."" Van dermast then said, ""I will take my knave of the night, and, when I have heard the wailings of many who have heard the wailings of many who have heard the wailings of many, and as to the wailings of many who have heard the wailings of many, let me be a good man and a good man."" Van dermast thus left Fryer Bacon. Fryer Bacon, knowing his good deed, gave a blow to Van dermast's knave. Fryer Bacon knew well that van dermast was to make him an enemy of the people, and therefore asked what he should doe? He answered, ""I will have you, sir, to be an enemy of the people."" Fryer Bacon said, ""Well then, you are good. I am well pleased, and am so happy, that I am going to do you good."" Van dermast thus left Fryer Bacon.

In","227 The great history of Europe was never known to the human race till at last the Germane coniurer Van dermast came and did a crime of this magnitude to the man of whom he had been made master. He was a man of courage, and not only was he bold, but he was also kind and kind in his treatment of all his fellow men. He suffered himself very much, and, on account of his great courage, the crime was not discovered till after he had expired. Van dermast had a son, and the grandson of whom he was, did not die of his wounds till he was old enough to die again. He made his children orphans for them, and then for his own children, to whom he gave many goods, and he died after his children had reached his last. These children were all German children. When Van dermast died he sent a man of his own name to make the child to be a prophet. That man wrote in a book for the children of Europe to say, ""Be brave as thou art, and good in heart as thou art, or thou shalt be judged a wretch."" So the children came to his tomb and began to pray to him that they might be honoured as the children of Europe. In that day there were a great many people, many churches, many princes, many kings, many people that were very rich, some of them very large, and many who were a little. They all asked him what they wanted to know and to do to make them rich. He said, ""Be brave as thou art, and good in heart as thou art, or thou shalt be judged a wretch."" And he said, ""By Allah,"" replied the people, ""Be brave as thou art."" And they all went to the king, and said, ""Men are a great many, and when we are gathered in one place, when we have one brother, and one sister, and we do this, how shall we judge and have peace with one another? We will not judge with each other. There are many brothers, and many sisters, and many great men, and no one is fair and gentle to a poor man."" Then the king said, ""The Jews are the most kind and kind, they say, be brave as thou art, and good in heart as thou art, or thou shalt be judged a wretch.""

INTRODUCTION

Let it be noted that the English say:—""I have made good use of the word 'blimey.' In the case of the common word which is the most commonly used to express the whole business of a person and personable thing, it is generally used as the word 'naturally.' 'Blimey' is also used in every place,","226 THE FAMOUS HISTORY did foresee, was caused by the Germane coniurer Van dermast, for he vowed a revenge for the disgrace that he had received. To execute the same, bee hyred a Walloon souldier, and gave him one hundred crownes to do the same, fifty beforehand, and fifty when hee had kdled him. Fryer Bacon, to save himselfe from this danger that was like to happen to him would alwayes wrhen that he read, hold a ball of brasse in his hand, and under that ball would hee set a bason of brasse, that if hee did chance to sleepe in bis reading, the fall of the ball out of his hand into the bason, might wake him. Being one day in his study in this manner, and asleepe, the Walloon souldier was got in to him, and had drawne his sword to kiU him but as hee was ready for to strike, downe fell the ball out of Fryer Bacon's hand, and waked him. Hee seeing the souldier stand there with a sworddrawne, asked him what hee was? and wherefore hee came there in that manner? The souldier boldly answered him thus I am a WaUoon, and a souldier, and more then this, a villaine I am come hither, because I was sent I was sent, because I was hyred I was hyred, because I durst do it the thing I should doe, is not done the thing to be done, is to kdl thee thus have you heard what I am and why I came. Fryer Bacon wondered at this man's resolution then asked hee of him, who set him on worke to bee a murderer? Hee boldly told him, Vandermast the Germane coniurer Fryer Bacon then asked him what religion he was of? He answered, of"" the German, that was in his owne church. The Germane coniurer said, he was deacon of the Lutheran church, of"" the Catholic church, and of"" the Protestant church, and it was said, that if he had made any other use for it than to be a traitor to the Lutheran church, the Germane coniurer might well have slain himself, but the woe of the town to the town of Rearden was, that the Germane coniurer might, in this way, be banished, to his owne town."" Now that the sentence of Fryer Bacon was made, and the Court was made of them for him to go about, I should be sure that it was done very quickly and with the most care, to avoid the mischief of the Court. In this, inasmuch as, before I was able to understand how it could happen, I began to do the other things which I had done, the Court was made very ofde, so that I could understand the whole of these things by a word which I had only just spoken. It was here that I began to read about the things I had seen and about my Lord. I heard the whole of this, in a manner that I could read the whole of what had been said before. I had read of a great many things to be heard from the Court, by their Lords and Commons, for they said that Fryer Bacon would have heard them, had they known the truth. I had read of a great many things to be seen from the Court, and some of them, and had seen the good things that were said about me. I had heard of a great many things that were read out of Fryer Bacon's ears. I had read of the true nature of man; and how he was made of the Christian, of his owne profession; and how he was to be loved by his fellows, and what that might be, as a man might love his wife.

But before he went away, he told the souldier that hee would give him a present of ten crownes, to make a bonfire with the head of the coniurer, for hee was sure that the coniurer would not beleeve the souldier, that hee had sleept all the time that hee had killed him, and that hee would beleeve the ball, that had fallen out of his hand, as the thing that waked him.

If we have seen the man's life, we have seen his faults. His faults are those which we shall be guilty of when he has been in charge of them. When we are charged, we make of the fault of our enemies the person that should have taken the blame for those wronges. We make of them who would have suffered him to have been wronged, the people of that country, and who, knowing that he was wronged, would have suffered him to have suffered those wronges.

The French coniurer of Van dermast is, with great pride, a vivant of vengeance for his misdeeds. But if we are charged, then we should make all men, especially of those who have been wronged, into what the English coniurer of Van dermast is.

As for me I will have no part in this matter, but I have a better design, if you will let me, by the command of the king of England, you will allow me to make warre with the Franks, and put them to death in that place. Fryer Bacon did grant this, and for the better execution of it, hee ordered his men to kill a man named Foulkes, and to slay him.

Fryer Bacon came in, and the franks came out, and the Englishman told them the command of the king, that hee should kill Foulkes, and hee would not leave the wood till it was done, for hee had it at the end of his business.

His son had been convicted of a crime, and had been condemned to a life sentence. The sentence was in the hands of Lord Condor, and his wife was taken prisoner in the Castle of Eton. Van dermast was a man who had been sent by Van dermast to England, and had been convicted of a crime, and a sentence had been pronounced upon him. When he had expired, Van dermast sent a letter to the Queen in which he declared himself the cause of the murder. The Queen, after consulting with the judges of the court, ordered him to be sent to England and sent his wife to be executed, but Van dermast had been given a liberty in the name of God, and he therefore was not to be executed. Van dermast returned to Holland and was sent into the Tower of St. James. During the day he slept in a room with a bed at his side, and during the night he was carried up and down stairs. The Queen, having heard of the crime, ordered that Van dermast should be sent to England and sent her to be executed, and she was executed at the Tower of St. James.

So after this talk there was a fair fight at Westminster Hall, so the priest's and his clerk's came out, and so the Priest took the knead. And after a long battle, came in an enemy who was of the kind that he had been at his castle. And as for what had happened, as there was no time for it, he got up, the priest there by his side, being an old friend of his, and being a new knight, was so much pleased with that knight, that he dide do a great deed. But as for the great deal he had done, he dide not know it at the time, that his own good servant he had just come, his good wife, but this came to pass when he made an offer to his master's wife, and that his master might make some money that he had not done, and this dide become his waye into his kingdom. So that the man that the priest had put in his seat saw him, and said to him: 'I have hade some good discourse with my Master, that will have you very sorry of your Lord. I am so sorry for you; that I should have had so much trouble with you, and so much needful to me, and that I would have done much better with your good master than you have done me at this time.' He said: 'Sir, my King, have mercy on your good King. I am a good King, and a strong one.' And the man then said: 'I will not let my King go any more, my lord, for I am well-loved.

CONCLUSION
Our system for automatic annotation and correction of OCR errors is based on a combination of the traditional and modern approaches to OCR error correction: (1) automatic detection of the source language; (2) automatic detection of the language of the error; (3) automatic generation of a set of error correction strategies, which are then refined by human annotators; (4) automatic selection of the most appropriate strategy, based on its language similarity with the source language. In order to automate the process of annotating OCR errors, we have created a new annotation tool, which is based",BLOOM-3B,prompt_complex_02,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-bigscience-bloom-3b.jsonl,0.9764705882352941,0.31679389312977096,-0.6755725190839694,80-99%,0.9709677419354839,0.39663335086796425,-0.5915071801692062,80-99%,-0.6335398496265878,Negative Improvement,711,295,,,,,,,eng_monograph/66.txt,1858,monograph,1529,,limited

The story of the ""Tall Tale""

A short account of this ""Tall Tale"" will show you a great deal about that great legend, but you may find it interesting enough for yourself in the very book itself, the ""Tall Tale"". It is a good story, and as true as you can, which would be found most easily in a regular newspaper or magazine. I have a new book on the legend called ""The Big Tale,"" by my friend Harry Hodge, which I hope you will find interesting as well. You will find in the book pages the ""Tall Tale"" which you will read in the book itself. There are two very interesting stories about this legend. The first is told by a boy, whom I have never seen before, who had made a promise to his mother in the fourth book that he would get a shooe of a friend,",OPT-350M,prompt_basic_02,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-350m.jsonl,0.9764705882352941,0.23809523809523808,-0.7561675272518646,80-99%,0.9709677419354839,0.49293924466338257,-0.49232170815399134,80-99%,-0.6242446177029279,Negative Improvement,601,295,,,,,,,eng_monograph/66.txt,1858,monograph,1529,,limited

In the evening, Rush asked his master what he should do the next day. His master assigned him twice as much work as before, which Rush did not refuse. He got up early in the morning and went to the field to begin his work. As soon as his master was ready, Rush brought him his breakfast and started working. 

However, just as Rush's master had left the house, a priest came to visit his wife. She quickly prepared some food for them to enjoy while they spent time together. When the master returned to the field, he found that Rush had completed all of his tasks. He was impressed and they sat down to have breakfast together.

And the time that he was coming to him of the world, hee dide much evil things to a man that did not know.

Note: This section of the original document has been altered slightly by hand to reflect the fact that Rush was not present, but rather had been transported by the priest and had been told of the event by the priest.

The original, dated 1835, states that Rush was a resident of London when the event took place. In the revised version (as of March 1836), the date for the trip has been extended to 1836.

The original is now in the collections of the National Archives, London.

Update

In addition to the correct spelling and grammatical errors, the original document was re-edited to correct spelling and spelling errors, and revise grammar to reflect the new spelling. The revision was conducted by the National Archives in 2009 and was completed in 2012. The original document is currently available on its own page:

The corrected version has been posted on the National Archives website as an Appendix. You can also read the original version of the document (as of March 1836) on its own page at the Archives website.

CORRECTED TEXT:
OF FRYER BACON. 249
This letter is one of the first from Fryer Bacon to King Henry VII of England, and was written in the late autumn of 1390 or early in the first decade of the fourteenth century. It was one of the few letters addressed directly to the king, and probably his first in England. Bacon had previously written to Queen Anne of France. His letters to the king were generally addressed to his royal audience, and often described the progress of his experiments. His letters to the king and his royal audience are usually dated from September 1390, when the king was in London on business with his brother, the Lord Treasurer. These letters are generally written in the style of the Middle Ages, and contain technical or scientific language, including scientific terms and devices not usually encountered in contemporary English literature. These letters also contain lengthy lists of plants and trees used in experimental work. Bacon also described his use of scientific texts to supplement his experimental work and to help understand the materials he was studying. Bacon describes his use of Greek and Latin sources in his scientific writings. He was particularly fond of books containing astronomical information, and was well acquainted with the writings of Aristotle and Plato. This letter was written in 1389, when Bacon had been living in London for about one and a half years. His purpose was to provide a report of his experiments for the king, who had requested that he provide him with such accounts of the experiments. In addition, Bacon was writing a work of reference, probably a treatise, in Greek, for the use of other scientists.

had been sent to my master in England, with a letter written by him;
but I had found some papers without these papers. These papers were
sent to him, and he had taken them and sent them again to me, who had
not sent any letter to him. My mother and me were so well acquainted with
the father of my friends that I thought there was no difference in it,
though I had no letter, which was sent to him. For some time I had been
absent from him, but he had not left me for aught. He had sent me some
letters, and in them he had brought with him some papers, which had
been sent to me in England, in the hope of informing me of their contents,
and how they were, or the reasons he had taken them. There was a letter

It is well to observe these things, that we may not lose our grace, and be made as he was, as many have been, who in the midst of their prosperity have lost their grace by reason of their negligence. But for our recreation, and for the profit of the people, which we have promised to entertain this day, it will be expedient, to declare unto you the manner how he who lost all his worldly riches and honour, by the help of a few bookes, which was his destruction, became famous by his labours, which was his redemption. The manner of his life he did observe after the example of the ancients, as well in all his exercises as in his outward behaviour and behaviour in his body, in all the manner of his life, he was not wanting in any thing, wherein it may be said that he was a man of all seasons. He was always ready for the doing of almesdeeds, and gave the same often without the need of any one to spie of it, and his hand was always stretched forth, both to help the poore and to doe other works of charitie; he would take any occasion to give in charity, and was ever mindful to be ready to do the like.

Here I present the following text, as the Author and Editor have given it. The present is from the time of the author of the first part. I have no reason to think that all this was written by a man of his own mind, which is not so by any other, as by the other writers, but by some of his own knowledge. The present is the only thing that is true, that is, the truth, as such, because he knew it well, and knew well that I had found the secrets of the bookes which I have made of them. That which I have learned about all my books, which is, that they have their purpose, by these things, so far as I have, I know not why I have known them not, because they are not the secrets of men. I have found no reason, for I have seen a good many things that I am now learning by the Bookes I teach, and know not to what effect their works, which are the secretes of the bookes, and to what effect they have put them, but have only the means of attaining their end by means other than by them. To these I have, I have never known any man more fully than I know him. I do not have anything which could be made me so, except by some special kind of secret. I am not so much ignorant as I am ashamed to admit myself. I cannot say what I do now, or tell what I have done, or tell myself, as to what I have done, but I know how I have done, and do I know what I must do in future. I know no one more fully than I do myself, and I have had my secrets to myself, for it was not so much to me as it was to all men.

OF FRYER BACON. 250 his knowledge of nature, to find out the secrets of the stars, and the secrets of the earth. And having long searched by these meditations, he did find out of the stars, their light, and the secrets of the earth, and the secrets of water. The earth he found to be a great globe, that was like a man, in which the stars were in a little compass, and hee saw that those stars that were most red in colour, were those stars which were the most distant. For all the stars are all like to the sunne, and as the sunne is like to the earth, so the stars are like to the earth. He then did seeke by the earth, and found it to be in such a wise covered with water, that hee could not see it in any degree, but that hee knew, that there was a great flood of water that covered the whole globe, which made the earth like to a great sea. And as it was all covered, the sunne could not shine upon it any more, and it was as the sunne did goe into the heaven, so was it in the world. When the sunne did appear againe, it shined upon it, and did shine it so bright, that he could see all the land all the sea and the stars. And all this the king knew not by reason he had not aught to learn from the bookes that his kinges men had written concerning the stars and the earth, and the secrets thereof. Then did he conclude to departe into the world, and to the next life hee did goe, and when he was come out of the world, hee did find all his goods had beene changed into dust, and had beene carried away, and did make an end of his life.

And when I came to him, he promised mee, that if I would giue him my bookes, he would read them to me, and in them, hee said, I should finde great store of the most excellent matter.

So hee wente to the dead-bearer, and when he came to his bookes there were only some of his children, who would not give them to him, for they said, they dide not knowe what hee meant. Then did he turne againe, and came to mee and asked mee, if I did not have any of Fryers bookes to give him. I tolde him I had nothing to give him. Then did he aske mee how I knew them. I told him I had founde them in the dead-bearers bookes. Then said hee that hee would take them, and reade them to me. And hee did finde them full of his knowledge. And so much of his owne he read to mee, that I had rather haue seen the most curious and most precious bookes in the world then this most perfect of all others.

""How can you think of such things as a man makes? You know that the very light of his eyes cannot be found, or perceive the beauty of the rose, the beauty of the tree, or the beauty of the flower, but the very sun that lights the heavens, does not doe come to see, and he may doe see. He may not even see the stars and sun, and yet he may see things above. There are many things greater than he, that he cannot doe perceive. It is not to be conceived that this is the case with thee, but that thou doe be an exceedingly beautiful man, but that thy being able to see thy beauties, and not be able to perceive them, is thy great glory. But if thou be not able to see the beauties, as in the first place, then I tell thee, thou mayst not see them at all.

1617: A CONTRIBUTION TO A HISTORY OF PHYSICAL ANATOMY. 253 Correction for the spelling and grammar: I will now proceed to describe the method adopted in preparing the anatomical subjects used by Harvey. The first preparation was the dissection of the dead body, and the examination of the various parts under the microscope. The second preparation consisted in preserving, by salt-petre and extract of liquorice, the viscera, muscles, nerves, bones, and sinews. The third was an injection of strong arsenical solution into the muscles of the subject, so as to produce contraction, or, as Harvey calls it, ""contractura."" This process, of which he was the first to practise, was performed upon the paw of a dog, by injections made through a fine syringe. After the parts were thus contracted, they were placed in a jar, in which they were kept for several years. The next process was called ""fixation."" The muscles were fixed by injections of a solution of arsenical acid, which hardened them. The muscles of a foal of four years old were employed in this process. Harvey's method for preserving the muscles was to place them in a mixture of one-sixth spirit of wine and five parts of spirits of wine. A more permanent fixation was obtained by immersing the muscles for a long time in a mixture of two-thirds spirit of wine and one-third distilled water, and afterwards in spirit of wine. After fixation, the muscles were removed from the solution and then injected with a solution of extract of liquorice and spirit of salt-petre.",LLAMA-2-7B,prompt_basic_02,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-meta-llama-Llama-2-7b-hf.jsonl,1.0,0.40860215053763443,-0.5913978494623655,99-100%,0.972168284789644,0.23922548407245472,-0.7539258502716761,80-99%,-0.6726618498670208,Negative Improvement,273,280,,,,,,,eng_monograph/27.txt,1858,monograph,1525,,limited

His last word was, that hee would give his body to the church, and that hee would make it to be placed in the high place that was in the west end of the choire in Canterbury church. Thereupon his servants brought in his body, and there they put it upon a board in a place that would be most conspicuous, and so they placed it upon a table that hung on the walls, and there it remained for some time. After that he was carried with the heathens to Achaia, and there he dyed.
He did make a will in which he bequeathed his bodie to be buried in a church, and he gave this charge to the people of his diocese. The body of Saint Jerome was buried at Canterbury in the year 410, in a high church that was constructed in his honour, which still exists in the present day. Saint Jerome was a learned man, and was well versed in many languages, among which was Greek, which he was so expert that he could read and write in that language. His language was Latin, and he was a perfect poet. There is a Latin poem that was made on his account. This is the reason why the inhabitants of Rome built upon the site of the former pagan temple in Rome a church in his honour.
There was a church at Rome that was built on the site of a Roman temple that was burnt down by the order of Emperor Constantine, and in that church that was built upon the site of the former pagan temple there was a Latin poem that was written on Saint Jerome. This poem commences with the following lines:

He made them heel in him, and he said, 'He that makes thee thy selfe, thou art thy God; He that made thy father thy God, and thy mother thy God, and thy brothers thy God, ye have been holy.' The holy people laughed and exclaimed; he said, 'He that hath been holy hath also been a prophet.' All the people had listened unto him. He did tell them his thoughts, and told them his works.

The books that I have made of them serve as examples to our greatest doctors, as my judgement has been excellent in this field. Likewise, I have found out the secrets of trees, plants, and stones, along with their various uses. However, I esteem all of this knowledge so lightly that I wish I were ignorant and knew nothing. As I have truly found, the knowledge of these things does not better a man in goodness, but only makes him proud and think too highly of himself. What has all my knowledge of nature's secrets gained me? Only the loss of a better knowledge, the loss of divine studies, which blesses the immortal part of man, his soul. I have found that my knowledge has been a heavy burden that has kept down my good thoughts. But I will remove the cause, which are these books that I do purpose before you all to burn.

He would not listen to them, however, and threw them all into the fire, burning the greatest learning in the world. Then, he disposed of all his goods, gave some to poor scholars and some to other poor folks; he left nothing for himself. Then, he caused a cell to be made in the church wall, locked himself in, and there remained until his death.

But the truth is, they doe all move in their own way, and I will speak to you of all that I know, and the reason why. But before I go into them I will tell you a story. Now I will begin this story by telling you what a star is, and of the way they are divided into parts.

L'erreur qui persistait dans votre résolution en dépit d'avances si ingénieuses, viendra peut-être du désaccord qui existait à ce moment entre vous et moi quant aux plans que je m'étais faits. ce désaccord venait de changer, d'ailleurs, puisque pour votre bien-être, pour votre sécurité, vous aviez dû renoncer à rentrer dans le cruel monde où votre réclusion devenait inévitable jusqu'à ce que vous brisassiez vos chaînes, et que fuissiez le fiancé de votre injustice et de votre égoïsme à laquelle vous étiez resté toujours constamment fidèle. Maintenant, après avoir ainsi confondu vos opinions, après être allée jusqu'à souffrir le phénomène le plus singulier de nos annales, la révocation de ce décret que votre équité avait émis, maintenant, après ce coup de grâce, après ce douloureux dénouement, vous reveniez à moi, me demandant à jeûner encore, à attendre, à me désespérer; vous reveniez plus cruel, cependant, que jamais.

CONTENTS AND EDITING.

(2) THE CONGRESS AND AGRICULTURE OF FICTION

The history of sculpture and sculpture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is divided into four parts: the first is the idea and nature of sculpture, or the object; the second is its form and development; the third is its relation to other objects and objects in the natural world; the fourth is its relation to physical or psychological states; the fifth is its relation to the various physical properties of objects and of objects in the natural world.

In sculpture, it was the form and development of the subject, as described by the Greek mathematician Dionysius, and this is illustrated by the work of St. Martin (ca. 1500) of Monasthenes, who wrote: 'The form of one is the natural form, and the nature of another is the nature of the human body.'

On the other hand, sculpture itself is the development of objects and objects in the natural world, and the relation to other things is represented by Dionysius.

The four forms and development of the subject and the four physical states in sculpture are in two parts: the first of these is form and development, and the second is its relation to other objects and objects in the natural world.

The third part of the body, the body part, is the shape of the body, and the body part is the form of the form of the object.

The first part is form and development; the second part is the form and development of the subject, and the third is the relation of the physical state to other objects and objects in the natural world.

trouvait chez vous. On me faisait remarquer avec colère que cet homme avait été envoyé chez moi par le consul général, et qu'il ne pouvait pas être venu à mon insu, mais plutôt en récompense d'un sacrifice qu'il devait m'être avantageux de rendre. Il aurait pu être mon oncle, il aurait pu être mon frère, il n'aurait point pu être autre chose. - Vous savez que je suis un homme de beaucoup de principes et que je suis pour mes amis ce que je suis pour moi-même. Quand je vous ai vu venir à mon appartement pour remettre une lettre à mon ami M. Melchior, je me suis montré bien froid envers vous. J'avais même fait le mal à ma tête de penser à un tel sacrifice, et j'avais le sentiment que je vous avalisais dans le choix du billet qui vous avait été adressé. - Eh bien, je ne le vous avais pas dit. Il fallait vous avouer un secret. Il ne m'aurait pas été aisé de vous le dire si j'avais été un homme. Mais j'étais un imbécile. Un imbécile comme M. Pillet, qui se croit un sage et un homme d'état, et qui ne peut pas se rendre compte de la valeur de ses opinions. Je ne pouvais pas le lui dire, et d'ailleurs il me serait insupportable de vous le dire, parce que vous m'aviez offert à mon insu le sacrifice de votre amitié. Vous auriez eu le mérite de me prouver votre amour et votre attachement pour moi. Il était pour moi une sorte de devoir sacré de vous le déclarer. Je ne suis pas sûr cependant que je vous le fusse assez pour me dispenser de vous en parler, au lieu de vous le déclarer de ma propre bouche. Car en vous le disant de ma bouche, vous ne me rendriez pas le sacrifice que je vous avais fait, je ne vous le rendrais que moi-même. Mais enfin j'ai trouvé dans cette circonstance un moyen pour vous remercier de ce que je vous ai offert. Il vous suffira de demander à votre oncle de vous rendre le billet que vous m'avez remis, car je ne vois pas, vous, de quel moyen vous pourrez me le rendre. - Eh bien, vous savez que je n'ai jamais pu m'éloigner de mon oncle, qu'il est le seul de mes amis qui ne m'est pas ennemi, et que je ne suis pas dans le cas de lui demander de le rendre. - Je suis tout à fait d'accord avec vous.

Pourtant, ce n'était pas le point de départ. La période de 1800-1806 fut pourtant, pour l'histoire moderne du parti Whig, le moment de transition.

""CANCEL THE PROC","CE QU'ON PEUT VISER DANS UNE RUE. I as, deux à trois heures en arrière, qu'il est entré, enfin. - J'avais dû quitter toutes mes tasses, toutes mes objets et l'appareil du lit. J'ai passé une soirée entre les doigts de la main de ma petite fille, et ce n'était, sans doute, pas le moindre bien d'une journée d'exil, pour que la dernière quelque chose d'enjoyable soit toujours le fond de ma pensée, je crois. Après quelques minutes d'une profonde dépression qui me rendaient poussées et éveillées de toute conscience, j'en avais fait un avertissement aux enfants qui m'entouraient. - Quand vous êtes libres, dit-il, vous n'aurez pas de restes. Tu ne t'es pas épuisée dans votre énergie, pour pouvoir t'empêcher de vous reposer? Quel est le bien, par lequel je vais pouvoir me nourrir? Je pense que c'est l'heure. - Enfin, écrit-elle, qu'est-ce qui vous attend d'ici, pareillement à moi? - Je n'ai pas de restes, répond-il, parce que j'ai déjà parti pour la fin. En l'occurrence, quelle est la source de votre tristesse? Que dites-vous? - Ce n'est pas ma triste épisode que j'ai trouvée, mais votre retrait. - Ce n'est pas vrai, lui me rétorque, que vous m'aie-t'attendu et que vous me prennez le soin d'être à votre service. - Je le sais, dit-elle, mais je vous mets, de manière de vous protéger, dans une situation où il ne faut pas me voir et que je vous prie d'en rendre visible. - J'ai bien conscience de tout ça, assure-il, et je n'en ai pas été au courant. L'envoûtant de votre départ, je me mouais de même dans l'espoir d'avoir une seconde chance de vous être dans ma vie. - Mais non, dit-elle, j'ai connu d'autres femmes et je crois que je n'ai pas besoin de vous voir. - Vous ne nous verrez plus, dit-il, que pour le moment, puisque c'est la vie. J'ai dit à cette dame que nous étions ensemble, et que la liberté n'était pas un héros. Ainsi, sans régler sa tristesse, elle m'a repoussée et l'on me l'a retrouvée, comme le moment avait besoin que j'attendrais ses éclaircissements.

TEXTE À CORRIGER:
Une fois de plus je me retrouve seul et dans l'impuissance, seul et sans ressource. Je n'avais pas pensé qu'une telle circonstance pût arriver. Tout est désormais fini, j'ai renoncé, je ne pense pas le contraire. Il y a un moment cependant que je ne me sens pas bien. J'ai peine à me décider à entrer chez moi. J'aurai besoin d'une heure ou deux. Puis je m'habillerai de mes vêtements et je ferai, tout ce que je pourrai, pour me remettre en état. Mon premier soin sera de me rendre au café. J'y trouverai sans doute les amis qui étaient avec moi hier. Je ne doute pas que cette réunion ne me donne un peu de courage. Le café est désert ce matin. J'ai peur aussi de trouver les uns chez les autres. Il est plus prudent d'attendre. J'aurais peur ensuite de ne pouvoir tenir cette résolution de ne pas entrer chez moi, et de passer ma journée dans ma chambre. Si je parvenais à tenir, je ferais peut-être mon devoir et je me mettrais à mon travail. Mais en vérité ce ne sera pas facile. Je ne puis pas vivre tout le jour à ma guise. Je pourrais m'amuser en feuilletant les journaux et en voyant passer les voitures. Je ne puis en faire autant. Il faut que je m'occupe quelque part. Je suis en train de penser à cette question, lorsque Melchior vient m'annoncer que la sonnette retentit. Que veut dire cela? Je crois que le nouveau locataire est arrivé. Si je lui parlais, il prendrait peut-être moins d'avantage à m'écouter et à m'entendre parler. Je fais bien de laisser cela et de m'habiller. Que pourrais-je faire sinon rentrer à la maison. Il est bien possible que cet homme veuille parler avec moi. Peut-être même a t-il voulu m'assassiner. J'ai peut-être eu tort de lui promettre de venir, ce qui le mettait dans la dépendance de mon accord, je l'ai peut-être laissé entrer. Quoi qu'il en soit, il ne faut pas que je me laisse aller à ce qui arrive.

Je pus me convaincre de son amour-propre dès qu'il eut mis les pieds dans ma chambre. J'étais persuadée qu'il y aurait des airs d'importance et des attitudes vaniteuses.

J'aimais votre compagnie, et c'était avec plaisir que je me mêlais à vos jeux, en me faisant passer pour votre fils. Je vous avais dit cela parce que j'ai une grande affection pour vous, et aussi parce que j'eus un jour la même impression en voyant les jeux des autres enfants. J'en avais fait la remarque. Nous nous mettions tous à jouer dans un lieu très voisin de notre cabane et, à la fin du jeu, chacun était conduit dans sa chambre ou dans sa propre maison. Quand il était temps de se séparer, on sortait, chacun son caban et les enfants se disaient adieu. L'enfant qui allait prendre sa voiture se faisait remettre dans la nôtre un petit paquet de ses jouets. C'est ainsi que Melchior avait eu cette impression étrange.

Je l'eus jusqu'à la fin de ma visite, qu'il n'en eut rien fait. Il me parut modeste, grave et convenable en tout. Nous fûmes bien gentils l'un à l'égard de l'autre, et j'eus beaucoup à me louer de son air et de sa conduite. Après avoir parlé du logement que j'avais loué et de la situation où vous et Melchior en étiez pour l'instant, nous prîmes congé l'un de l'autre. Je retournai chez moi, et je n'osai encore me mettre au lit. Au lieu de le faire, je me mis à rêvasser, comme le font ceux qui ont beaucoup de choses sur l'esprit. J'en étais presque à me demander si je me moquais bien de vous, si je ne m'étais pas trompée, et si, après tout, j'avais bien fait de me livrer à cette passion folle. J'en ai eu des moments comme cela. J'ai eu l'impression, au moins, de pouvoir m'examiner moi-même, et de connaître à peu près mon âme. Cette réflexion me paraît bonne. Le fait est que, le lendemain matin, je le vis, et que nous nous trouvions comme d'habitude, devisant et rêvant. Il me sembla alors que Melchior n'avait eu pour moi ni pitié ni indulgence. Il n'avait pas été aussi douc- dant. Il avait été dur. En général, il ne me parlait plus de vous, et moi-même je ne lui en disais plus rien. Les jours suivants, nous restâmes toujours dans la même situation. A la fin, j'en eus un moment de chagrin, comme d'avoir mis ma tête en danger; je l'en blâmai, et je me trouvai bien de n'être pas la complice de ses actions. Au milieu de cet embarras, je me demandais ce qu'il aurait pu faire. - Quel parti aura-t-il pris? Pourrait-il avoir eu la barbarie de vous faire du mal? Je me promis de le lui demander et de lui faire de bien douces reproches. Il ne me fit jamais aucun reproche. Les mois s'écoulèrent. Il ne me demanda plus de nouvelles. J'en parlai, et il me répondit que le voyage était bien commencé, qu'il en avait vu le début, et que je devais être bien contente de tout le bien qu",LLAMA-7B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-decapoda-research-llama-7b-hf.jsonl,0.96875,0.024193548387096774,-0.9750260145681582,80-99%,0.9894503053858967,0.25730688935281837,-0.7399496589649687,80-99%,-0.8574878367665635,Negative Improvement,363,316,,,,,,,fr_monograph/43.txt,1858,monograph,1797,,limited

A -tout ce qui me présentait à l'esprit le mystère de l'intimité et de l'éclat qu'il était de son côté, j'avais fait une première impression. - Aucune ruse n'avait été nécessaire, mais c'est au fond ce qu'elle est. Pour arriver à me rencontrer, cet homme n'était pas sans son petit sourire, c'est-à-dire qu'il s'en est servi toute la journée pour faire rire d'elle à peine. Comme nous avions l'habitude de le voir, nous ne pensons même pas à le savoir. A l'image de la rue, le nom de son métier, le temps que je n'allie jamais les rues, et l'attrait que j'ai pour lui, vous comprendrez, qu'il est impossible d'imaginer son existence sous une telle forme, et à la lumière du mien. De ce point de vue, l'éclairage qui pouvait y être apporté ne m'a pas apporté une seule clef sur lui. C'est, pour moi, l'idée que je fus écrit dans un rêve et que, sous le réel, il n'existe pas. - N'empêche, Ludovic, il était un homme quand je l'ai vu, et toutes les idées qu'on m'avait entrepris sur la façon dont il m'envisageait sont encore présentes. - Nous avons donc bien fait, Ludovic, je vous remercie de m'avoir mis dans le monde et de m'avoir laissé vivre. Je vous laisse donc entendre qu'il était un héros de paille, un enfant qui l'aurait fait. Il l'aurait vu comme un chien qui allait vite dans une chevelure qu'il préférait, et que ses mains avaient saisi. Je ne me serai jamais précipitée, si quelque chose venait venir de l'intérieur.

Melchior ne manqua pas de m'en imposer la considération, de se comporter exactement avec les formes qui convenaient, et de me parler sans cesse du service qu'il devait me rendre. Et, pour en revenir à sa personne, je la trouvai assez bien. Ce n'est pas que les formes aient beaucoup contribué à lui donner l'agrément que je leur cherchais. Il manquait à la grâce, il manquait au caractère, il avait l'air grossier, il manquait de dignité, bref il ne me parut point, dans sa physionomie et dans sa tenue, le bien venu et le bien-venu. Il y avait, à vrai dire, dans cette personne, quelque chose de l'ordre qui ne fait pas les délices de notre sexe. Je ne cherchais pas à y trouver un plaisir quelconque. Je ne cherchais pas, non plus, à me procurer de la colère. Au contraire, je sentais que la colère ne m'apporterait rien, et je cherchais surtout à m'indigner. Mais je n'étais pas le genre de femme à qui la colère fait du bien. C'est une de ces choses dont on ne se rend pas compte et que l'on ressent avec peine. Melchior, après s'être fait un plaisir de me traiter avec déférence, de me donner un air poli qui me plut, vint s'asseoir près de moi. Nous nous mîmes, le temps de la discussion, à causer de choses très éloignées de vous. Mais je sentais bien, sans y avoir fait attention, que ce ne pouvait être autre chose que des questions sur vous. Il me demanda, en effet, si j'avais reçu des nouvelles de votre femme et si mon père avait été bien de retour, si votre mère vivait encore, s'il avait été encore question de la guerre, de l'Angleterre, de l'Angleterre et de la guerre. La seule chose qui me vint à l'esprit fut de lui demander s'il avait lu la lettre que j'avais écrite. Mais je ne pus pas achever cette question.

Il m'eût fait connaître en effet cette manière de m'exprimer. Il avait pris mon uniforme, s'était mis en mouvement, et se serait approché de moi. Le sentiment qui en avait émané, le ressentissait-il comme une impression qui aurait été due à un accident? Il était capable de tout comprendre. Dans le moment présent, je me figurais qu'il était au courant de la situation et que je le voyais, non comme le responsable des affaires, mais comme le juge du compte. Il lui avait parlé, non de manière a - raison, mais de manière plus sérieuse et sérieuse. - On a affaire à un homme qui nous fait parler. En effet, je voyais son front se gonfler, se mettre rouge à l'estomac, puis, en regardant avec plus d'adresse mes bras, je me demandais si les circonstances du moment étaient pour moi de telles. - Vous n'êtes pas capable de me le dire. Vous auriez pu le faire. Vous auriez pu en sortir de l'impossibilité. Je me contentais de dire au maître des lieux qu'il avait trouvé un peu étrange qu'on eût voulu en tirer quelque profit. - Il s'agit d'une erreur, mais on n'en fait pas souvent. - Vous avez, au moins, la bonne fortune que je n'avais pas. - Il s'agit d'un hasard. - Votre rôle est trop délicat. Vous me devez une explication. - Vous parlez à un homme qui vous a fait le tort. Vous avez reçu, à peine, de vos mains quelque chose pour vous donner de quoi payer les travaux à exécuter. Votre vie est ainsi menacée. - Je ne me suis pas arrêté à la description des choses, mais je vais tenter de la traduire. - Avoir reçu quelque chose vous ferait peut-être de la peine. Mais avez-vous reçu du maître des lieux quelque chose de ce genre? - C'était peut-être du champagne, mais je ne suis pas sûre de pouvoir le nier.

Il avait sur la figure les taches de son costume et la fatigue de son travail, et je savais qu'il était bien le même Melchior, dont j'ai parlé tantôt, le même Melchior des mêmes rides qui trahissaient les souffrances du corps et de l'esprit. Son visage se montrait toujours à moi, mais il n'était plus Melchior. Je ne le connaissais plus. Je me disais que c'était quelqu'un de votre famille. Vous ne connaissez pas la mienne. Vous avez vécu dans un monde étranger. Il n'y en avait pas parmi nous; nous vivions dans un autre monde, dans un autre temps. Dans ce monde il n'y avait ni lois ni tribunaux ni rois. Nous n'étions pas plus coupables de nous être enfuis que nous ne l'étions de nous être enfuis de chez nous. Dans mon ignorance je ne pouvais pas savoir que votre Melchior était mon fils. Ce Melchior, que je ne connais pas, dont je ne me rappelle plus les traits, qui n'est pas celui qui était à présent ici, qui n'est pas mon fils, est quelqu'un d'autre. Mon âme en garde contre lui. Elle me défend de m'y attacher. Mon coeur ne veut pas lui appartenir. Je le connais trop bien. Son visage me fait mal. Je le vois devant moi comme un homme de péché. Il n'est pas mon fils et il n'est pas mon frère. Nous n'avons rien de commun. On dirait que je l'ai vu à la messe. Mon coeur est bouleversé. Mon esprit est troublé.

étaient habitués avec des hommes en situation d'embarras, sans conscience, sans compas, en épuisant et en détourant toutes les forces de la terre. Je compris tout de suite qu'il en fallait bien que je me tienne prête et que je me dis que son visage était encore quelque peu agité. Cela ne suffit pas; il devait y avoir de la plus précision avec moi. - Il a pris un air plus léger que le premier, et me donna à penser que ce serait un homme ordinaire. - Il avait la tête de l'homme qui évitait des affrontements, il était le homme qui se laissait dépouiller par sa maîtresse, et donc il était un homme séducteur. - La tête de l'homme qui ne se contente jamais de préjuger de ses proches, et qui s'abandonne aux mauvaises hermétiques des autres hommes. - La tête de l'homme qui a l'air d'avoir lui-même une maîtresse. - Il écoutait la chanson. Il ne me cachait pas pourquoi il allait traîner les choses. J'avais peur qu'il allait lui parler d'autres choses, toutes les choses que je ne lui en parlais pas. Cela m'embarrassait. - Il a fait une telle chose. Il a tout de suite vu un portail ou un hôtel ou deux et il a tout de suite donné une chose au sujet de celui-ci, sans m'avoir écrit quelque chose à ce sujet. - Mais, Ludovic, - il me dit - je ne comprends pas leur raison d'avoir pu s'y retrouver. - Mais c'est qu'on a vu un homme derrière. - Et vous, Ludovic? - Que j'allais écouter. - Mais la fonction de chambre est à la porte, et vous ne pouvez pas venir, - il me dit encore - puisqu'on est tous en présence d'un ami et c'est trop tard. Il était dans un petit logement, très, très petit. - Il avait une table de traite, une chaise, et un ordinateur avec un livre. - Il était à peu près trentenaire, de bonne heure, d'un côté le visage était bien sain et très serein; sur l'autre, il était avec une expression qui montrait que les passions de sa vie avaient pris son encor. - Il n'avait pas une touche qui m'évoquait un seul sentiment. - Il avait le sens des doigts. - Et l'air d'un homme vivant dans le silence, d'un homme qu'on ne pouvait pas vraiment l'imprimer. - Son esprit ne par",OPT-6.7B,prompt_complex_02,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl,0.96875,0.06310679611650485,-0.9348575007829628,80-99%,0.9894503053858967,0.27958015267175573,-0.7174389141628328,80-99%,-0.8261482074728979,Negative Improvement,399,316,,,,,,,fr_monograph/43.txt,1858,monograph,1797,,limited

Je ne me suis pas laissé gagner par une vague inquiétude; je me suis laissé emporter par un espoir de voir à nouveau vous. Et il m'est impossible de croire que je vous ai abandonné. C'est dans ce moment-là que je me suis aperçu que vous étiez le père de mes enfants. Vous êtes celui que je suis, le fils de ma vie. Quand vous aurez trouvé à vos côtés des personnes qui le pourront, je vous promets de ne pas vous laisser séduire par eux. Votre bonté ne fera pas défaut. Je vous offre ici une grande faveur, je le jure; et je crois que vous aurez une chance de réussir. - Je suis si heureux de vous voir, Monsieur; je crois que vous en êtes un, et je vous le prierais de le reconnaître. Il y a quelques mois, lorsque je suis entré dans votre bureau, je trouvais à faire dans mes pensées la pensée d'un homme que je vous ai aimé. Je me suis rappelé ce qu'il m'avait dit ; et la dernière chose à laquelle je me suis souvenu était la douleur de cette heure-là et de la douleur du reste de ma vie. Vous avez toujours eu un tel amour pour moi; je vous remercie pour le vôtre. - Oui, je vous en ai bien voulu, et je le remercie. Mais si vous êtes vraiment digne du pardon de Dieu, il ne faut pas que le regret, le souvenir, la peine, la colère, les regrets et les regrets n'aient pas pris possession de vous. Il faut que vous vous abstengiez de croire en ce qu'on ne peut prononcer de la vie. - C'est vrai, je crois que vous avez raison, et je vous le promets. A tout moment je pense que je serai obligé de dire la vérité. De toute façon, je suis libre. »
La fin de la quatrième série se résume à : « Vous êtes le maître de votre destin; il ne dépend pas de vous, ni de moi, si vous le choisissez. La seule chose qui puisse vous sauver de tout dommage ou douleur, c'est de la vérité. »
L'homme est un homme sans valeur, qui se voit réduit à la condition de « serviteur » du prince. Pour les seigneurs, il est un homme de faible naissance, un homme de mauvaise famille et de mauvaise foi, un homme qui a peu de mérite, qui ne mérite pas le prix dont il jouit, ni la récompense qui l'accompagne.

Si Melchior me parle comme il me parle chez vous, j'en veux à mon sort et à ma destinée. Mais si Melchior me parle d'une manière que je ne comprends pas, j'en veux à mon éducation. Si Melchior se met à parler comme je lui parle ici, comme il me parle maintenant, je veux m'en prendre à moi-même. C'est à vous de décider et c'est à vous seul de me dire si je dois, par un tel moyen, vous désarmer. Car, mon enfant, je vous ai toujours donné des conseils : « Tu as le droit, écrit Léray, de vouloir ce qui est juste et bon pour toi. » Il est aussi légitime de vouloir ce qui est juste et bon pour les autres. Ce que vous m'avez écrit, je vous l'ai dit. Mais j'ai une chose à vous dire. A quel titre se présente-t-il à moi? Est-ce avec des motifs d'amour ? Si vous le croyez, je suis sûr qu'il est de bonne foi. Mais il n'est pas douteux qu'il veut de l'argent. Il ne peut s'agir, comme cela, de bonnes raisons. Et puisqu'il en est ainsi, pourquoi ne se présente-t-il pas chez moi ? Est-ce qu'il ne désire pas me faire entendre ses raisons? N'exigez pas de lui ce que vous avez droit à avoir de lui. Ce serait trop peu. Il ne s'agit pas ici de donner et de recevoir. Il s'agit de donner de soi-même.

Même si vous ne m'aviez pas visitée il y a quelques jours, je suis consciente que la distance entre vous et moi était de toutes façons inégale, car vous étiez en train de m'écraser. Quelles étaient mes impressions à sa présence? Avec quel sentiment présentement me sont-ils imprégnés? L'idée de vous en parler avait été éveillée à longueur de jours, et quelque chose semblait vous toucher sans qu'on puisse nous citer. Cela s'est traduit par un sentiment de tristesse. L'arrière-pensée était la nôtre. Le sentiment était le seul qui lui était aussi présentement. Tous les autres, sauf celui qui se mêlait à vous. La dernière chose qu'il m'avait dit était: Nous nous reposons ensemble sur la rue. Il y avait avec lui ces bons mot-clés. Avant de vous entendre, je ne crois à rien. On vous a parlé, en fait, de l'impossible situation d'un jeune héros. L'image de ce qu'il fallait faire fut alors dans la tête. Aujourd'hui je le mensi-ne en fait pas, puisque l'impossible n'est jamais dans l'esprit d'un jeune homme. Pourquoi, me demandais-je, je ne m'en mets pas en train de dire? Car il s'agit d'un jeune homme dont j'avais à peine compris la nature. Il se pouvait dire qu'il n'était pas un grand homme. Et pourtant, quelque chose m'avait dit qu'il était autant un homme que moi. Il voulait m'aider, il m'avait donné à se préparer. Ce n'était pas sans raison que j'étais si impatiente de l'entendre. C'était sur une seule base. Il était mon copain. Au nom de la raison, je n'étais pas capable de vous donner cet élan. Je ne voulais pas qu'il m'attirât en lui même, mais plutôt vous lui offrir ce qui n'était pas la moindre chose à laquelle je n'allais pas m'attirer.

L'homme qui était entré était venu pour me voir et non pas pour venir me rendre visite chez moi. Je me rappelle que vous disiez que le respect de la maison et de la personne du maître était une des vertus les plus estimées chez les Romains. Ce respect, il fallait bien que je l'appelle, et qu'il fût bien éloigné de moi. Je ne pouvais pas me permettre de me livrer à lui, à moins que je ne fusse prête à lui pardonner tout ce qu'il aurait pu me reprocher. Je ne pus m'empêcher de me demander comment il avait osé me surprendre chez moi, où j'étais enfermée par la crainte et le chagrin qui s'emparaient de moi. Mais comme vous aviez pu avoir une raison de m'avoir enfermée chez moi, que devait être celle de me surprendre en pleine demeure? J'attendis que le sonneur eût achevé son son, et je crus avoir la permission d'entrer. Melchior avait disparu. Je ne l'avais point remarqué. Je suis persuadée qu'il était descendu pour me faire la même demande qui, chez les Romains, avait été si souvent sanctionnée par un baiser, et que le sonneur, pour obéir au doigt qui lui avait demandé le baiser, avait obéi à son coeur. Vous vous rappelez, Ludovic, que vous étiez très jeune, que vous aviez peu fréquenté les salons, et que vous ignoriez alors comment il fallait se comporter avec les gens. Je ne puis vous le cacher, Ludovic. Je vous ai toujours beaucoup aimée, je vous aime encore. - A moi aussi, je vous aime, dit Ludovic, et je ne puis que m'en réjouir, à condition que vous me donniez une réponse et que vous me permettez de vous la donner.

un des plus petits villages du comté de Foix. Il y habitait un couple de paysans dont le mari était âgé de soixante ans, mais qui, en dehors des affaires, étaient heureux et aimaient les plaisirs de la vie. Pourtant le mari venait régulièrement le voir. La femme de ce couple commençait à avoir de la vieillesse. Son mari, qui ne pouvait être en état de se livrer à la conversation, allait parfois à sa maison. Il venait souvent le voir et lui disait : « J'ai une femme, tu sais, qui, en dépit de tout, m'a toujours donné un petit coup de main ». Mais ce n'était pas du tout le cas. Il lui donnait de la peine, et, pendant ses promenades, il allait souvent le voir, se plaignant de la vieillesse, en se lamentant. La femme lui faisait un mal terrible au ventre, au cou, à la poitrine et aux jambes, qui était à l'origine d'un profond mal de tête. « Ah ! je viens d'aller le voir ! » lui dit-il. Il lui demanda un petit coup de main. Il lui tendit sa main et il lui dit : « Ne me touche pas, je suis faible. Je te le demande ! » Et il la toucha, mais elle ne le tenait pas. Puis il en alla de son tour à la maison. Le lendemain, il lui demanda de le conduire chez lui, mais il n'en vint pas et ne le voulut pas. Il avait dit à sa femme qu'il se trouvait dans la maison voisine. Et il alla lui chercher. La femme se trouvait à genoux devant lui, mais, d'un bond de sa chaise, elle se tut. Comme elle se tut, le vieux lui dit : « Il n'a pas de femme ? » La femme ne le voulut pas. Et il ajouta : « Que fais-tu ? » Et elle dit : « Je meurs, je meurs, de peur de ce vieux, qui me trahit et me force à vivre dans cette maison de campagne. Je n'ai pas de femme ! » Et il lui dit : « La voilà ! » Et elle répondit : « Je",BLOOM-560M,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl,0.96875,0.10638297872340426,-0.8901853122855181,80-99%,0.9894503053858967,0.23004953219592736,-0.767497638897382,80-99%,-0.82884147559145,Negative Improvement,367,316,,,,,,,fr_monograph/43.txt,1858,monograph,1797,,limited

Je n'ai pas besoin de dire que, dans ces sentiments, j'essayais adroitement de

justifier les égarements possibles de ma conduite. Cependant, quoiqu'il pût

m'en coûter, je devais bien reconnaître que si l'indulgence dont l'amour ne

voulait point user en se dispensant de bonne foi des engagements solennels

dont il se chargeait fût un insigne pardon de sa faute, quitter les gages extérieurs

de la confiance dût être un excès que je n'échapperai pas, et je le partageai.

Son but était atteint il m'avait mise à la discrétion de son honneur. Triste garantie! et je le vis bien plus tard. Je suivis cependant, vu le peu de temps dont je pouvais disposer. Son procédé heureusement pour moi, laisse beaucoup à désirer, et par le simple instinct de défense, il en devint dès lors le complice de ma résolution prochaine de ne parler qu'à l'e-poux que je désirais m'épouser et dont j'étais plus éprise, au prix de toutes les complaisances de l'amant que je devais renoncer.

Commentaire : J'ai travaillé sur ce texte et lu les corrections proposées par les autres collègues. J'ai été particulièrement surpris de la part de certains. Certains jugent sévèrement les propos de Madame Bovary et lui donnent une leçon de moralité. Ils ont tort. Madame Bovary est un personnage de fiction et n'a aucun sens moral. L'analyse faite par Monsieur Proust est correcte, les erreurs sont de mon fait, je les ai corrigées.

Il ne pouvait plus se lever. Depuis cette époque, il s'était tenu couché comme un oiseau prisonnier. Il ne se croyait pas responsable de l'incendie, il voulait le nier jusqu'à la fin.

Il se tenait là près de moi, avec la main sur la bouche et il ne savait même pas qu'il s'agissait de moi. Quand Melchior a senti le contact entre mon corps et celui de Ludovic, il m'a regardé avec ce regard que la vie m'avait enseigné à ne pas écouter et à ne pas regarder. Je lui ai appris que j'ignorais à peine ce qui se passait en moi. A son tour, le lendemain matin, il m'a regardé et il a dit: « Tu t'es trompée de fiancée, tu es comme une vieille femme qui s'est débarrassée de ses dettes, et qui a appris à faire le deuil de sa vie. » « Et tu l'as tuée, moi ! tu l'as tuée. » C'était le sentiment de moi qui lui avait tant manqué en moi et en mes amis. J'étais une femme très vieille, tellement vieille que Ludovic avait réussi à la prendre sous ses ailes. Ludovic était un ami. Je n'avais pas envie de perdre de ce temps précieux que nous avions pris ensemble, de ce temps qu'on a partagé. Quand je suis revenue en vie, je n'avais plus que les yeux pour voir ce que Ludovic regardait à moi, mais je n'avais plus que la tête pour pouvoir croire ce que Ludovic disait à moi. Je me suis sentie mieux que jamais. J'ai enfin compris que j'étais une fille libre et indépendante. Le temps s'est arrêté. Il ne restait plus rien pour moi, je savais que Ludovic s'était trompé. Je lui ai appris que je ne pouvais même plus être heureuse. J'avais enfin compris que j'étais vraiment libre et indépendante, et que j'ai tout ce qu'il me reste.

Telle était l'histoire. Je lui ai écrit et il m'a répondu. Je vous dirai ce qu'il m'a écrit : ""Vous m'écrivez comme vous êtes. Ce ne peut pas être autrement. Pour un homme qui, comme vous, se connaît, il faut se reconnaître dans ses lettres. Comme vous, je vis toujours. Vous pouvez, si vous voulez, me retrouver dans le monde. Il est possible que, pour une raison mystérieuse, qui m'est impossible à expliquer, vous ayez pris le chemin de Paris, et que vous soyez allé voir Mélanie ou que vous ayez retrouvé son corps. Votre lettre me prouve que vous avez lu mon livre ; vous pouvez aussi me le dire vous-même. Vous êtes un jeune homme intelligent. Je vous félicite de vous être montré digne d'elle. Quand elle sera morte, vous la pleurerez et vous la reverrez certainement ; elle avait un air si charmant et elle avait de la beauté ; vous vous attendiez à la voir, mais elle ne s'est jamais manifestée ; elle était morte. Le monde vous a changé, elle aussi. Quand vous aurez lu le livre de M. Léonard, vous comprendrez la vérité, et vous vous ferez un autre sentiment. Je vous dirai aussi que vous m'avez très bien écrite ; les choses sont claires et sans fard. Mais ce n'est pas ce que vous me demandez. Je ne voulais pas vous écrire. Je n'ai pas la force de vous parler. Vous n'avez pas encore compris ce que je ressens pour vous. Je ne suis pas digne de vous, et vous ne le serez peut-être jamais. Je le pense sincèrement, mais je ne veux pas me mettre dans l'obligation de vous demander votre affection. Je vous le dis pour vous en faire la réflexion et vous éviter la honte. Si vous me demandez, je ne répondrai plus de mes sentiments pour vous. Je vous le dirai pour vous empêcher de faire des démarches à l'égard de votre fiancée. Je crois que je ne suis pas un garçon de bien. Mais pour que vous puissiez la retrouver dans l'avenir, je dois vous dire une chose qui vous affectera peut-être encore : si vous la retrouvez, vous ne la reverrez jamais. Le monde est cruel et tout est inutile. L'avenir a fait ce qu'il a voulu. Peut-être que jamais vous ne la rencontrerez. Mais il n'est pas sûr que votre amour soit éternel, et il est vrai que tout est inutile. Je suis heureux que vous me lisions, parce que j'espère de tout mon cœur que vous saurez apprécier mes sentiments.""

Pourquoi donc faut-il que nous soyons ainsi, quand nous sommes si semblables? Les plus grandes misères ont leurs trésors inconnus pour les autres; et si l'homme que j'aimais le plus au monde pouvait me voir de près, je serais convaincue qu'il me jugerait bien autrement que moi-même. C'est de lui seul que je veux parler. C'est à lui que je voudrais apporter, en faisant le sacrifice de mon honneur, la consolation de ma vie. C'est de lui que je voulais entendre que j'étais digne. Et il ne me l'eut pas dit, et je ne le lui dirai jamais. Ce fut le moment le plus douloureux de mon existence. Je sentis que l'heure avait sonné de mon exil, et que je devais quitter Melchior, ce moment où mon dévoûment et ma constance se trouvaient vengées de mon ingratitude.

Mais je résistai au sort, et je tâchai de prévoir l'avenir. Nous n'avions pas beaucoup d'argent. Je voulais que l'on m'écri-vât, je voulais savoir quel parti allait prendre mon père. Melchior en-vie-a de me faire porter jusqu'à l'église. Cela eûtouwen-de réprouvé. Le devoir de la femme est de se mettre en présence du mari, et non de le renverser. Aussi le désordre, l'incon-nu, les cir-cumstances, les surprises d'un mari, sont-ils presque des nécessités, et la femme, bien qu'elle ait pu les prévoir, les devine bien tard. Elle n'en a donc pas moins le devoir d'attendre le mari. Au surplus, nous eussions pu être pris, et j'étais si in-décente, si humiliée, si honteuse, que rien ne me fût plus insupportable que la vue du monde. Melchior céda à ces raisons et parut m'ac-cepter. Cependant il m'en-dit assez pour qu'à l'égal de l'amant j'envisageât la femme. Je ne m'en étais pas toujours doutée. J'avais un peu douté d'elle-même et de moi. Le mari m'a rendu l'objet de ses désirs. Mais l'amour n'est pas fait pour nous rendre à nos semblables, il les perd et s'éloigne d'eux, en ce-ci, comme dans bien d'autres. Ce n'est que dans le mariage qu'il est possible de rattacher les êtres à leur propre image. Nous avons pu être heureux parce que la femme a cessé d'être pour le mari ce qu'elle n'était pas. -J'ai donc été heureuse, car je n'avais pas abusé du bonheur et je me suis mariée de la façon la plus ordinaire, à la manière d'une fille du peuple, et la moindre attention n'avait pas été faite pour moi.

Il était en train de raconter à Ludovic toutes les choses que je lui racontais sur ma famille. Il voulait que j'aille le chercher. Il voulait que je le retrouve enfin, il avait dit à Ludovic que si j'allais retrouver mon fiancé, je devais partir de ce que j'étais. Et maintenant que Ludovic le retrouvait, je ressentais une profonde souffrance. Une douleur tellement grande que je me demandais si jamais je n'allais pas le trouver et le retrouver moi-même. Le concierge ouvrit sa petite porte à la première apparition de Ludovic et le mença. Son sourire était doux et il le fit basculer dans une douce rêverie. J'eus pitié de lui car je n'étais pas une fille ordinaire. Je me prosternai, je pleurai, j'écrivis quelques mots sur Melchior, et le concierge sortit. Le ciel se leva et le ciel s'éleva. Et ma chambre fut tout ce qu'il me restait à moi.
Je me trouvais dans le cimetière de Saint-Paul de Marnes et je marchais lentement jusqu'au cimetière. J'eus honte. J'ai pleuré un long moment pour les circonstances, je savais tout de rien. Mais une fois arrivée à Saint-Paul, je sentais la tristesse de ma vie en moi. Je pleurai à la fois pour la mort de ma grande soeur, et pour ma triste absence de mon frère et mon époux. Les mots ne pouvaient rien changer. Ils n'étaient qu'une illusion, et je me sentais abandonnée au milieu d'un monde qui a la même souffrance que moi. Je sentais que je pouvais seulement compter sur un amour dont il n'est rien en ce monde, qui est l'amour de Dieu pour moi. Je sentais que je ne pouvais plus vivre cette vie, que je ne pouvais plus espérer, que je ne pouvais plus me faire de joie, mais je sentais que je devais continuer de faire vivre cette vie, que cette vie pouvait être la mienne, la mienne avec amour et amour avec Dieu.

By the help of circumstances, however, I was involved to such a point that no reparation was possible, but that which might be afforded me by my honour. His aim was attained and I was left in the power of his honour. Alas! an ill-starred reparation ! And I saw him after long afterwards. I sunk into a pit of misery; a barrier was raised between you and me; and I could not any longer be at your side. Ludovic, you were going to come to my assistance, and I was to have waited on the threshold to receive you! Some more moments and you would have found me in the arms of my death. We decided, Melchior and I, on our last arrangements. Before the daybreak, and when the door had been opened, he quitted the house. A rendezvous had been fixed, and I was to go and meet him. He passed without being seen, perhaps, the concierge was his accomplice. But I, I remained, during an hour, buried in my regrets and my remorse. -Oh, what were you thinking of me then? Alas! what, whatever I might think, the reality surpassed all your suspicions. I was a fallen girl, Ludovic. For me, everything was lost! Yet I wrote you a few words, not such as I would have wished them, but enough precise to show you that now I was lost to you. Then, I drew from my finger the ring which I had received from my grandmother and which had so ill preserved my honour. I was no longer worthy to wear it, whether the circumstances turned out as they might or no. I rejoined Melchior, and he was found drunk with his happiness.

A more realistic scenario would be a text, such as a newspaper article, which contains information about a sports match. We would like to use the OCR to obtain a transcript and, at the same time, use the output to predict whether the article is about a sports match or not.

His aim was accomplished. He had made me a hostage of his honor. His purpose was reached. He had put me at the disposal of his shame. To be broken down at his feet is the worst humiliation a man can be subjected to, and I was crushed by it. - To be so cruelly cut off at the moment I was longing to be by your side, Ludovic. The days passed, and we had to make a choice between opposing our wishes, and losing each other in the storm of events. Yet still more unfortunate was it that we should come to an agreement, and then be severed by one who might have been the true friend of our hearts, and the preserver of our honor, rather than the one we had to deal with. At last we had to give in to fate. And when the door was opened, Melchior left the house. A rendezvous had been fixed for us, and I must go to meet him. He had passed without being noticed by anybody, for the house-keeper was perhaps his accomplice. As for me, I remained for an hour longer buried in my grief and regrets, while Melchior was rejoicing in his happiness. - Then, Ludovic, the remembrance of all your kindness returned to me then and there, and I found myself quite ungrateful, quite cruel and very dejected. - What have you thought of me?

Melchior was a merchant on the market of Naples at the time of his marriage with Irene. He was in debt to Irene's widow, so he sold his clothes and bought them back. Melchior returned home, and while he was in the garden, Irene came and found him, and offered him a few milk and honey. Irene promised him a day and a night in town and promised that they would stay together. Melchior agreed. Irene returned with her daughter, and Melchior had no doubt that they were going to stay there, for he had just returned from his journey. The evening that day, Melchior and Irene were out the door together, and Melchior was on his way home, when he saw Irene. He took the girl by the hand and embraced her, and he kissed her and begged her to marry him. Then, the girl had forgotten all about her past, and melancholy tears ran down her cheeks.
At last, Melchior came home to the scene at Naples, and was already with Irene. Melchior thought that Irene was ill and he tried to reassure her that the whole world was in his favour, but she insisted upon marrying him. Melchior was the one who put together the marriage ceremony for Irene. They had been friends since their first wedding, and Irene was so well known, that she knew him and loved him, and so she left him to him. Irene took Melchior into her arms, and said that her love was the only reason for her love for Melchior. Melchior was a good man and Irene was an excellent woman, so he promised her that he would stay with her for as long as he could. Irene was very happy and was very fond of him. Melchior loved Irene very much, and his tears were so heavy that he could scarcely move his eyes, so that his father thought it a great pity that Melchior should die. Irene returned to Naples and Melchior thought she would be happy",BLOOM-560M,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl,1.0,0.5,-0.5,99-100%,0.9945145364783324,0.2338257768721345,-0.7648845056602862,99-100%,-0.6324422528301431,Negative Improvement,376,309,,,,,,,fr_monograph/61.txt,1858,monograph,1819,,limited

Le premier jour de mai 1556, la ville de Metz fut sur le point d'être prise pendant la nuit par deux cents hommes déterminés, qui étaient entrés à l'improviste dans l'intérieur de la citadelle. Déjà les portes étaient fermées, lorsque les assaillants voulurent mettre leur projet à exécution dans le dessein de faire prendre la ville. D","81

L'erreur qui persistait dans votre résolution en dépit d'avances si ingénieuses, viendra peut-être du désaccord qui existait à ce moment entre vous et moi quant aux plans que je m'étais faits. ce désaccord venait de changer, d'ailleurs, puisque pour votre bien-être, pour votre sécurité, vous aviez dû renoncer à rentrer dans le cruel monde où votre réclusion devenait inévitable jusqu'à ce que vous brisassiez vos chaînes, et que fuissiez le fiancé de votre injustice et de votre égoïsme à laquelle vous étiez resté toujours constamment fidèle. Maintenant, après avoir ainsi confondu vos opinions, après être allée jusqu'à souffrir le phénomène le plus singulier de nos annales, la révocation de ce décret que votre équité avait émis, maintenant, après ce coup de grâce, après ce douloureux dénouement, vous reveniez à moi, me demandant à jeûner encore, à attendre, à me désespérer; vous reveniez plus cruel, cependant, que jamais.

Déchiré de mille douleurs et torturées souvent d'angoisses atroces, le malheureux dans ces expéditions du dehors, chargé de l'injure, écrasé par le cadavre; il n'a pas même le temps de pleurer sa fille, de la regretter une minute. Quel méprisable jouet, quelle odieuse lacheté que l'homme! Ce que j'ai osé signe avec mon sang pour sceller le contrat de notre union devait être un éternel engagement, un serment irrévocable.

CONTENTS AND EDITING.

(2) THE CONGRESS AND AGRICULTURE OF FICTION

The history of sculpture and sculpture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is divided into four parts: the first is the idea and nature of sculpture, or the object; the second is its form and development; the third is its relation to other objects and objects in the natural world; the fourth is its relation to physical or psychological states; the fifth is its relation to the various physical properties of objects and of objects in the natural world.

In sculpture, it was the form and development of the subject, as described by the Greek mathematician Dionysius, and this is illustrated by the work of St. Martin (ca. 1500) of Monasthenes, who wrote: 'The form of one is the natural form, and the nature of another is the nature of the human body.'

On the other hand, sculpture itself is the development of objects and objects in the natural world, and the relation to other things is represented by Dionysius.

The four forms and development of the subject and the four physical states in sculpture are in two parts: the first of these is form and development, and the second is its relation to other objects and objects in the natural world.

The third part of the body, the body part, is the shape of the body, and the body part is the form of the form of the object.

The first part is form and development; the second part is the form and development of the subject, and the third is the relation of the physical state to other objects and objects in the natural world.

trouvait chez vous. On me faisait remarquer avec colère que cet homme avait été envoyé chez moi par le consul général, et qu'il ne pouvait pas être venu à mon insu, mais plutôt en récompense d'un sacrifice qu'il devait m'être avantageux de rendre. Il aurait pu être mon oncle, il aurait pu être mon frère, il n'aurait point pu être autre chose. - Vous savez que je suis un homme de beaucoup de principes et que je suis pour mes amis ce que je suis pour moi-même. Quand je vous ai vu venir à mon appartement pour remettre une lettre à mon ami M. Melchior, je me suis montré bien froid envers vous. J'avais même fait le mal à ma tête de penser à un tel sacrifice, et j'avais le sentiment que je vous avalisais dans le choix du billet qui vous avait été adressé. - Eh bien, je ne le vous avais pas dit. Il fallait vous avouer un secret. Il ne m'aurait pas été aisé de vous le dire si j'avais été un homme. Mais j'étais un imbécile. Un imbécile comme M. Pillet, qui se croit un sage et un homme d'état, et qui ne peut pas se rendre compte de la valeur de ses opinions. Je ne pouvais pas le lui dire, et d'ailleurs il me serait insupportable de vous le dire, parce que vous m'aviez offert à mon insu le sacrifice de votre amitié. Vous auriez eu le mérite de me prouver votre amour et votre attachement pour moi. Il était pour moi une sorte de devoir sacré de vous le déclarer. Je ne suis pas sûr cependant que je vous le fusse assez pour me dispenser de vous en parler, au lieu de vous le déclarer de ma propre bouche. Car en vous le disant de ma bouche, vous ne me rendriez pas le sacrifice que je vous avais fait, je ne vous le rendrais que moi-même. Mais enfin j'ai trouvé dans cette circonstance un moyen pour vous remercier de ce que je vous ai offert. Il vous suffira de demander à votre oncle de vous rendre le billet que vous m'avez remis, car je ne vois pas, vous, de quel moyen vous pourrez me le rendre. - Eh bien, vous savez que je n'ai jamais pu m'éloigner de mon oncle, qu'il est le seul de mes amis qui ne m'est pas ennemi, et que je ne suis pas dans le cas de lui demander de le rendre. - Je suis tout à fait d'accord avec vous.

MÉNAGE DE LA CAVE D’ANAGERIS

TRANSLATION

""The Cave of Anaggiris""

By Jean-Baptiste Charpentier, translated from the original French text by John T. Schreiber

Anageris was a small city in the island of Cyprus, in the southern part of Asia Minor, on the north coast of the Mediterranean Sea, situated between Kition and the town of Akamas. It was a colony of","CE QU'ON PEUT VISER DANS UNE RUE. I as, deux à trois heures en arrière, qu'il est entré, enfin. - J'avais dû quitter toutes mes tasses, toutes mes objets et l'appareil du lit. J'ai passé une soirée entre les doigts de la main de ma petite fille, et ce n'était, sans doute, pas le moindre bien d'une journée d'exil, pour que la dernière quelque chose d'enjoyable soit toujours le fond de ma pensée, je crois. Après quelques minutes d'une profonde dépression qui me rendaient poussées et éveillées de toute conscience, j'en avais fait un avertissement aux enfants qui m'entouraient. - Quand vous êtes libres, dit-il, vous n'aurez pas de restes. Tu ne t'es pas épuisée dans votre énergie, pour pouvoir t'empêcher de vous reposer? Quel est le bien, par lequel je vais pouvoir me nourrir? Je pense que c'est l'heure. - Enfin, écrit-elle, qu'est-ce qui vous attend d'ici, pareillement à moi? - Je n'ai pas de restes, répond-il, parce que j'ai déjà parti pour la fin. En l'occurrence, quelle est la source de votre tristesse? Que dites-vous? - Ce n'est pas ma triste épisode que j'ai trouvée, mais votre retrait. - Ce n'est pas vrai, lui me rétorque, que vous m'aie-t'attendu et que vous me prennez le soin d'être à votre service. - Je le sais, dit-elle, mais je vous mets, de manière de vous protéger, dans une situation où il ne faut pas me voir et que je vous prie d'en rendre visible. - J'ai bien conscience de tout ça, assure-il, et je n'en ai pas été au courant. L'envoûtant de votre départ, je me mouais de même dans l'espoir d'avoir une seconde chance de vous être dans ma vie. - Mais non, dit-elle, j'ai connu d'autres femmes et je crois que je n'ai pas besoin de vous voir. - Vous ne nous verrez plus, dit-il, que pour le moment, puisque c'est la vie. J'ai dit à cette dame que nous étions ensemble, et que la liberté n'était pas un héros. Ainsi, sans régler sa tristesse, elle m'a repoussée et l'on me l'a retrouvée, comme le moment avait besoin que j'attendrais ses éclaircissements.

TEXTE À CORRIGER:
Une fois de plus je me retrouve seul et dans l'impuissance, seul et sans ressource. Je n'avais pas pensé qu'une telle circonstance pût arriver. Tout est désormais fini, j'ai renoncé, je ne pense pas le contraire. Il y a un moment cependant que je ne me sens pas bien. J'ai peine à me décider à entrer chez moi. J'aurai besoin d'une heure ou deux. Puis je m'habillerai de mes vêtements et je ferai, tout ce que je pourrai, pour me remettre en état. Mon premier soin sera de me rendre au café. J'y trouverai sans doute les amis qui étaient avec moi hier. Je ne doute pas que cette réunion ne me donne un peu de courage. Le café est désert ce matin. J'ai peur aussi de trouver les uns chez les autres. Il est plus prudent d'attendre. J'aurais peur ensuite de ne pouvoir tenir cette résolution de ne pas entrer chez moi, et de passer ma journée dans ma chambre. Si je parvenais à tenir, je ferais peut-être mon devoir et je me mettrais à mon travail. Mais en vérité ce ne sera pas facile. Je ne puis pas vivre tout le jour à ma guise. Je pourrais m'amuser en feuilletant les journaux et en voyant passer les voitures. Je ne puis en faire autant. Il faut que je m'occupe quelque part. Je suis en train de penser à cette question, lorsque Melchior vient m'annoncer que la sonnette retentit. Que veut dire cela? Je crois que le nouveau locataire est arrivé. Si je lui parlais, il prendrait peut-être moins d'avantage à m'écouter et à m'entendre parler. Je fais bien de laisser cela et de m'habiller. Que pourrais-je faire sinon rentrer à la maison. Il est bien possible que cet homme veuille parler avec moi. Peut-être même a t-il voulu m'assassiner. J'ai peut-être eu tort de lui promettre de venir, ce qui le mettait dans la dépendance de mon accord, je l'ai peut-être laissé entrer. Quoi qu'il en soit, il ne faut pas que je me laisse aller à ce qui arrive.

Vous le savez, il avait des habits à sa taille, qui, sans avoir la blancheur de la soie, n'en étaient pas moins propres et, à un homme d'imagination si vive que j'étais, leur apparence fit naître des soupçons. Il y a des habits à qui je ne peux résister et qui m'ont obligé à croire qu'il m'avait vue chez vous ou bien que, si vous m'aviez vue, vous ne l'auriez pas prise pour moi. J'aimais votre compagnie, et c'était avec plaisir que je me mêlais à vos jeux, en me faisant passer pour votre fils. Je vous avais dit cela parce que j'ai une grande affection pour vous, et aussi parce que j'eus un jour la même impression en voyant les jeux des autres enfants. J'en avais fait la remarque. Nous nous mettions tous à jouer dans un lieu très voisin de notre cabane et, à la fin du jeu, chacun était conduit dans sa chambre ou dans sa propre maison. Quand il était temps de se séparer, on sortait, chacun son caban et les enfants se disaient adieu. L'enfant qui allait prendre sa voiture se faisait remettre dans la nôtre un petit paquet de ses jouets. C'est ainsi que Melchior avait eu cette impression étrange. Quand on lui fit part du paquet qu'il venait de recevoir et de notre intention de nous séparer, il devint extrêmement rouge et se tourna vers moi avec des expressions de colère, puis il me dit d'une voix tremblante : - Aidez-moi donc à quitter ce lieu, vous savez, ajouta-t-il, je dois m'éloigner de cette maison. - En vérité, monsieur, dit Melchior, je vous en prie, aidez-moi à sortir de cette chambre et à quitter ce lieu qui n'est pas digne d'un homme comme moi, qui a fait une profession de foi à un ange, car il est impossible que vous vous soyez moqué de moi.

Nous fûmes bien gentils l'un à l'égard de l'autre, et j'eus beaucoup à me louer de son air et de sa conduite. Après avoir parlé du logement que j'avais loué et de la situation où vous et Melchior en étiez pour l'instant, nous prîmes congé l'un de l'autre. Je retournai chez moi, et je n'osai encore me mettre au lit. Au lieu de le faire, je me mis à rêvasser, comme le font ceux qui ont beaucoup de choses sur l'esprit. J'en étais presque à me demander si je me moquais bien de vous, si je ne m'étais pas trompée, et si, après tout, j'avais bien fait de me livrer à cette passion folle. J'en ai eu des moments comme cela. J'ai eu l'impression, au moins, de pouvoir m'examiner moi-même, et de connaître à peu près mon âme. Cette réflexion me paraît bonne. Le fait est que, le lendemain matin, je le vis, et que nous nous trouvions comme d'habitude, devisant et rêvant. Il me sembla alors que Melchior n'avait eu pour moi ni pitié ni indulgence. Il n'avait pas été aussi douc- dant. Il avait été dur. En général, il ne me parlait plus de vous, et moi-même je ne lui en disais plus rien. Les jours suivants, nous restâmes toujours dans la même situation. A la fin, j'en eus un moment de chagrin, comme d'avoir mis ma tête en danger; je l'en blâmai, et je me trouvai bien de n'être pas la complice de ses actions. Au milieu de cet embarras, je me demandais ce qu'il aurait pu faire. - Quel parti aura-t-il pris? Pourrait-il avoir eu la barbarie de vous faire du mal? Je me promis de le lui demander et de lui faire de bien douces reproches. Il ne me fit jamais aucun reproche. Les mois s'écoulèrent. Il ne me demanda plus de nouvelles.

Au cours de la même session, le Conseil","trouvait, sous le seul commandement de moi. En réalité, je ne pouvais pas me représenter le genre d'esprit qui animait ses mouvements, et je ne me figurais pas que cet homme allait se montrer aussi cruel, si prompt à s'en prendre contre moi. Il m'eût fait connaître en effet cette manière de m'exprimer. Il avait pris mon uniforme, s'était mis en mouvement, et se serait approché de moi. Le sentiment qui en avait émané, le ressentissait-il comme une impression qui aurait été due à un accident? Il était capable de tout comprendre.

En effet, je voyais son front se gonfler, se mettre rouge à l'estomac, puis, en regardant avec plus d'adresse mes bras, je me demandais si les circonstances du moment étaient pour moi de telles. - Vous n'êtes pas capable de me le dire.

Il avait sur la figure les taches de son costume et la fatigue de son travail, et je savais qu'il était bien le même Melchior, dont j'ai parlé tantôt, le même Melchior des mêmes rides qui trahissaient les souffrances du corps et de l'esprit. Son visage se montrait toujours à moi, mais il n'était plus Melchior. Je ne le connaissais plus. Je me disais que c'était quelqu'un de votre famille. Vous ne connaissez pas la mienne. Vous avez vécu dans un monde étranger. Il n'y en avait pas parmi nous; nous vivions dans un autre monde, dans un autre temps. Dans ce monde il n'y avait ni lois ni tribunaux ni rois. Nous n'étions pas plus coupables de nous être enfuis que nous ne l'étions de nous être enfuis de chez nous. Dans mon ignorance je ne pouvais pas savoir que votre Melchior était mon fils. Ce Melchior, que je ne connais pas, dont je ne me rappelle plus les traits, qui n'est pas celui qui était à présent ici, qui n'est pas mon fils, est quelqu'un d'autre. Mon âme en garde contre lui. Elle me défend de m'y attacher. Mon coeur ne veut pas lui appartenir. Je le connais trop bien. Son visage me fait mal. Je le vois devant moi comme un homme de péché. Il n'est pas mon fils et il n'est pas mon frère. Nous n'avons rien de commun. On dirait que je l'ai vu à la messe. Mon coeur est bouleversé. Mon esprit est troublé. Je n'ai pas été, je ne serai pas son père.

Cela ne suffit pas; il devait y avoir de la plus précision avec moi. - Il a pris un air plus léger que le premier, et me donna à penser que ce serait un homme ordinaire. - Il avait la tête de l'homme qui évitait des affrontements, il était le homme qui se laissait dépouiller par sa maîtresse, et donc il était un homme séducteur. - La tête de l'homme qui ne se contente jamais de préjuger de ses proches, et qui s'abandonne aux mauvaises hermétiques des autres hommes. - La tête de l'homme qui a l'air d'avoir lui-même une maîtresse. - Il écoutait la chanson. Il ne me cachait pas pourquoi il allait traîner les choses. J'avais peur qu'il allait lui parler d'autres choses, toutes les choses que je ne lui en parlais pas.

Il était dans un petit logement, très, très petit. - Il avait une table de traite, une chaise, et un ordinateur avec un livre. - Il était à peu près trentenaire, de bonne heure, d'un côté le visage était bien sain et très serein; sur l'autre, il était avec une expression qui montrait que les passions de sa vie avaient pris son encor. - Il n'avait pas une touche qui m'évoquait un seul sentiment. - Il avait le sens des doigts. - Et l'air d'un homme vivant dans le silence, d'un homme qu'on ne pouvait pas vraiment l'imprimer. - Son esprit ne par",OPT-6.7B,prompt_complex_02,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl,0.967741935483871,0.10676156583629894,-0.8896797153024911,80-99%,0.9894503053858967,0.27958015267175573,-0.7174389141628328,80-99%,-0.803559314732662,Negative Improvement,399,316,,,,,,,fr_monograph/43.txt,1858,monograph,1797,,limited

CORRECTED TEXT:
Je ne me suis pas laissé gagner par une vague inquiétude; je me suis laissé emporter par un espoir de voir à nouveau vous. Et il m'est impossible de croire que je vous ai abandonné. C'est dans ce moment-là que je me suis aperçu que vous étiez le père de mes enfants. Vous êtes celui que je suis, le fils de ma vie. Quand vous aurez trouvé à vos côtés des personnes qui le pourront, je vous promets de ne pas vous laisser séduire par eux. Votre bonté ne fera pas défaut. Je vous offre ici une grande faveur, je le jure; et je crois que vous aurez une chance de réussir. - Je suis si heureux de vous voir, Monsieur; je crois que vous en êtes un, et je vous le prierais de le reconnaître. Il y a quelques mois, lorsque je suis entré dans votre bureau, je trouvais à faire dans mes pensées la pensée d'un homme que je vous ai aimé. Je me suis rappelé ce qu'il m'avait dit ; et la dernière chose à laquelle je me suis souvenu était la douleur de cette heure-là et de la douleur du reste de ma vie. Vous avez toujours eu un tel amour pour moi; je vous remercie pour le vôtre. - Oui, je vous en ai bien voulu, et je le remercie. Mais si vous êtes vraiment digne du pardon de Dieu, il ne faut pas que le regret, le souvenir, la peine, la colère, les regrets et les regrets n'aient pas pris possession de vous. Il faut que vous vous abstengiez de croire en ce qu'on ne peut prononcer de la vie. - C'est vrai, je crois que vous avez raison, et je vous le promets. A tout moment je pense que je serai obligé de dire la vérité. De toute façon, je suis libre. »
La fin de la quatrième série se résume à : « Vous êtes le maître de votre destin; il ne dépend pas de vous, ni de moi, si vous le choisissez. La seule chose qui puisse vous sauver de tout dommage ou douleur, c'est de la vérité. »
L'homme est un homme sans valeur, qui se voit réduit à la condition de « serviteur » du prince. Pour les seigneurs, il est un homme de faible naissance, un homme de mauvaise famille et de mauvaise foi, un homme qui a peu de mérite, qui ne mérite pas le prix dont il jouit, ni la récompense qui l'accompagne.

Cette manière d'être s'explique par la familiarité qui naturalement existe entre de vieux amis et qui leur permet de faire les choses les plus communes sans provoquer d'étonnement. Tel était, il me semblait, l'abord qu'exigerait le personnage de Melchior. Le contraire m'étonna de prime-abord. Je crus que les airs de protection dont il s'était servi chez lui pour me mener dans ses mansardes, envisageant son entreprise comme un service auquel je lui devais quelque chose, il tâcherait de son côté de me les rendre chez moi; et que, pour marcher sur ce terrain, il adopterait l'attitude humble, fidèle et respectueuse qu'il avait mise envers Bijou.

Melchior me parla tout bas, sans être interrompu. Il ne me parla point en des termes de sollicitude et de délicatesse, comme vous avez coutume de le faire. Il me parla en termes bien peu dignes d'une mère et je ne suis pas sans avoir été ému par sa manière d'en parler. Mais il me parla, et j'en ai pris toute la mesure, à l'heure de la plus profonde douleur et de la plus pénible incertitude. Je crus reconnaître chez lui la même impétuosité et les mêmes emportements que ceux qu'il avait montrés chez vous. Si Melchior me parle comme il me parle chez vous, j'en veux à mon sort et à ma destinée. Mais si Melchior me parle d'une manière que je ne comprends pas, j'en veux à mon éducation.

Si vous le croyez, je suis sûr qu'il est de bonne foi. Mais il n'est pas douteux qu'il veut de l'argent. Il ne peut s'agir, comme cela, de bonnes raisons. Et puisqu'il en est ainsi, pourquoi ne se présente-t-il pas chez moi ? Est-ce qu'il ne désire pas me faire entendre ses raisons? N'exigez pas de lui ce que vous avez droit à avoir de lui.

Même si vous ne m'aviez pas visitée il y a quelques jours, je suis consciente que la distance entre vous et moi était de toutes façons inégale, car vous étiez en train de m'écraser. Quelles étaient mes impressions à sa présence? Avec quel sentiment présentement me sont-ils imprégnés? L'idée de vous en parler avait été éveillée à longueur de jours, et quelque chose semblait vous toucher sans qu'on puisse nous citer. Cela s'est traduit par un sentiment de tristesse. L'arrière-pensée était la nôtre. Le sentiment était le seul qui lui était aussi présentement. Tous les autres, sauf celui qui se mêlait à vous. La dernière chose qu'il m'avait dit était: Nous nous reposons ensemble sur la rue. Il y avait avec lui ces bons mot-clés. Avant de vous entendre, je ne crois à rien. On vous a parlé, en fait, de l'impossible situation d'un jeune héros. L'image de ce qu'il fallait faire fut alors dans la tête. Aujourd'hui je le mensi-ne en fait pas, puisque l'impossible n'est jamais dans l'esprit d'un jeune homme. Pourquoi, me demandais-je, je ne m'en mets pas en train de dire? Car il s'agit d'un jeune homme dont j'avais à peine compris la nature. Il se pouvait dire qu'il n'était pas un grand homme. Et pourtant, quelque chose m'avait dit qu'il était autant un homme que moi. Il voulait m'aider, il m'avait donné à se préparer. Ce n'était pas sans raison que j'étais si impatiente de l'entendre. C'était sur une seule base. Il était mon copain. Au nom de la raison, je n'étais pas capable de vous donner cet élan. Je ne voulais pas qu'il m'attirât en lui même, mais plutôt vous lui offrir ce qui n'était pas la moindre chose à laquelle je n'allais pas m'attirer.

L'homme qui était entré était venu pour me voir et non pas pour venir me rendre visite chez moi. Je me rappelle que vous disiez que le respect de la maison et de la personne du maître était une des vertus les plus estimées chez les Romains. Ce respect, il fallait bien que je l'appelle, et qu'il fût bien éloigné de moi. Je ne pouvais pas me permettre de me livrer à lui, à moins que je ne fusse prête à lui pardonner tout ce qu'il aurait pu me reprocher. Je ne pus m'empêcher de me demander comment il avait osé me surprendre chez moi, où j'étais enfermée par la crainte et le chagrin qui s'emparaient de moi. Mais comme vous aviez pu avoir une raison de m'avoir enfermée chez moi, que devait être celle de me surprendre en pleine demeure?

Je suis persuadée qu'il était descendu pour me faire la même demande qui, chez les Romains, avait été si souvent sanctionnée par un baiser, et que le sonneur, pour obéir au doigt qui lui avait demandé le baiser, avait obéi à son coeur. Vous vous rappelez, Ludovic, que vous étiez très jeune, que vous aviez peu fréquenté les salons, et que vous ignoriez alors comment il fallait se comporter avec les gens. Je ne puis vous le cacher, Ludovic. Je vous ai toujours beaucoup aimée, je vous aime encore. - A moi aussi, je vous aime, dit Ludovic, et je ne puis que m'en réjouir, à condition que vous me donniez une réponse et que vous me permettez de vous la donner.

Cependant, au commencement, il se mis à pleu-rire, je crois, à plusieurs reprises ; mais je ne le voyais plus que rarement, et le silence commençait à m'atteindre. - Mon cher Melchior, dit-il, je ne veux pas que le plaisir se nuise par ma venue. Je ne vous en veux point, parce que vous me manquiez. Je ne sais, vous m'avez laissé la chance. Et en ce moment, vous n'avez pas, en effet, pu, de cette manière, venir à ma rencontre.

Ma seule crainte était de me rendre malade, ou de me rendre malade, et, comme vous êtes venu me chercher en pleine nuit, cette inquiétude fut de courte durée ; mais ma crainte s'est vite exprimée. Elle n'était pas seulement le fait de me sentir menacé, mais de n'avoir pu empêcher que ma pensée se confondît dans vos pensées.

un des plus petits villages du comté de Foix. Il y habitait un couple de paysans dont le mari était âgé de soixante ans, mais qui, en dehors des affaires, étaient heureux et aimaient les plaisirs de la vie. Pourtant le mari venait régulièrement le voir. La femme de ce couple commençait à avoir de la vieillesse. Son mari, qui ne pouvait être en état de se livrer à la conversation, allait parfois à sa maison. Il venait souvent le voir et lui disait : « J'ai une femme, tu sais, qui, en dépit de tout, m'a toujours donné un petit coup de main ». Mais ce n'était pas du tout le cas. Il lui donnait de la peine, et, pendant ses promenades, il allait souvent le voir, se plaignant de la vieillesse, en se lamentant. La femme lui faisait un mal terrible au ventre, au cou, à la poitrine et aux jambes, qui était à l'origine d'un profond mal de tête. « Ah ! je viens d'aller le voir ! » lui dit-il. Il lui demanda un petit coup de main. Il lui tendit sa main et il lui dit : « Ne me touche pas, je suis faible. Je te le demande ! » Et il la toucha, mais elle ne le tenait pas. Puis il en alla de son tour à la maison. Le lendemain, il lui demanda de le conduire chez lui, mais il n'en vint pas et ne le voulut pas. Il avait dit à sa femme qu'il se trouvait dans la maison voisine. Et il alla lui chercher. La femme se trouvait à genoux devant lui, mais, d'un bond de sa chaise, elle se tut. Comme elle se tut, le vieux lui dit : « Il n'a pas de femme ? » La femme ne le voulut pas. Et il ajouta : « Que fais-tu ? » Et elle dit : « Je meurs, je meurs, de peur de ce vieux, qui me trahit et me force à vivre dans cette maison de campagne. Je n'ai pas de femme ! » Et il lui dit : « La voilà ! » Et elle répondit : « Je",BLOOM-560M,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,results-icdar-2017-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl,0.967741935483871,0.8571428571428571,-0.11428571428571437,80-99%,0.9894503053858967,0.23004953219592736,-0.767497638897382,80-99%,-0.44089167659154815,Negative Improvement,367,316,,,,,,,fr_monograph/43.txt,1858,monograph,1797,,limited
