LyeaRht h idle, licensee of the Revolving Battery Hotel, Woolloomooloo, for alleged slander conveyed to plaintiff's wife, to whom, according to the declina- tion defendant had said words to the effect that plaintiff had introduced to the defendant another woman as pliiliitiU's wife, and that the other woman had a baby with her. This was brought by Judge T. T. Smith at a plea of a libel and slander suit against defendant, and, while the court had decided to consider whether the matter raised by the plaintiff was in fact a matter of libel, this matter was to be heard and decided by the jury of three. The trial was adjourned until March 21st, and the defendant was acquitted of all but two charges on all points. On appeal the case to the High Court was then thrown out. Mr. Thomson and his attorneys tried to persuade the court of the propriety of the trial before it. The case was heard in the High Court. The jury was very much interested in whether the plaintiff had a son or daughter or a child. The jury decided that, if a child was present in any case, there was no reason to believe that the plaintiff was incapable of giving them a child at birth and no reason to believe that the plaintiff should have one at any time, the defendant being found guilty of all six counts. The defendant was found guilty of all six counts of which the jury were ordered to find on the plea of a libel. On the motion of the plaintiff to suppress the evidence the jury did so by removing the evidence by order of the court which contained the following statement: ""There was, before the trial, an affidavit which was made by Mr. J. N. Rolle, a former employee of the defendant, that Mr. Rolle was the agent of the defendant, who said that he was under the control of the defendant. At that time, Mr. Rolle did not have any agent for the defendant, who was under the control of the defendant, and at that time, under the control of the defendant, was not a member of the defendant's class. But the affidavit also stated, that Mr. Rolle had acted as agent in order to take part in an action against the plaintiff, which was later discovered to have taken place on behalf of the defendant, which had not been taken from the defendant. Mr. Rolle had never spoken to the defendant before at the time of the case; he had not been present during the trial on the day of the trial, or on the day before the trial."" In a motion made by Mr. Thomson, he said: "" The plaintiff's daughter, Alexander, was present at the trial.

My teacher says that my papers don't contain any grammatical errors. However, I always have a hard time identifying them because my writing skills are very poor.

The evidence of the witness was that he heard plaintiff uttering the words and afterwards the witness saw the plaintiff's wife standing by him, the other witness (Mrs. P.) said he saw plaintiff and another lady standing by him, the plaintiff's wife gave the witness the words:
The witness further stated that the other witness (Mr. P.) and he said to each other, ""I cannot help it""; the defendant gave plaintiff's wife and another witness a piece of sugar, and asked the plaintiff to do something for him.

The Plaintiff. Robert B. Smith, surety for his landlords, and others. The Defendant. James D. Smith, surety for his landlords, and others. This is an action brought by the said Plaintiff, in the name and at his own expense, against the said Defendant, in the sum of £200, for breach of his duty of a surety, under a contract of sale, executed between the said Defendant and the plaintiff and his landlords. It is pleaded by the plaintiff that the defendant, on the date of the contract, which was October 1st, 1889, made a mistake, by not referring to the payment of his landlord's arrears as required by the contract, and that he should have paid them, before he could be regarded as a surety. The defendant pleads that his misstatement was done for his own convenience, and was not the result of mistake, and that he did not intend that the payment of the landlords' arrears should be delayed. The defendant also asserts that his misstatement of fact was made by mistake, and that he has not been responsible for the delay of payment to the plaintiff. The plaintiff admits that he was not in the premises at the time that the contract was executed, and that the contract was never executed. The plaintiff asserts that it was the agreement of the landlords that the contract should be executed on the said date, and that the defendant had made a mistake in making his statement of facts. It is pleaded by the defendant that the plaintiff and the landlords intended the contract to be executed on the day it was signed, and the defendant did not intend that the plaintiff should have been made to pay the landlords' arrears to the contract on the date, but to pay them by the following date, that being October 10th. The defendant pleads that on the day that the contract was executed the plaintiff, who was in the premises, was present, and he said the amount due the plaintiff was £300, that he had done the contract with the plaintiff's agreement and that the other two plaintiff's landlords were also present, and that he would only pay £100.

In the case of the trial court in the absence of a verdict the jury found Mr. Norrie not guilty. On the contrary, he was ordered to appear before the court by a lawyer on the morning before. A jury which had found defendant guilty was called and ordered to give a verdict. The jury was then divided into two of the two parties.

MURDER AT WOLLONGONG.
MURDER AT WOLLONGONG. The Sydney Mail publishes a report, dated Wollongong, November 24, stating that last evening a fight took place in the town. One of the men who took part in it was named John Ryan, who died this morning, and it is believed he was fatally injured in the fight. The fight took place at a place known as Pine Grove, where some 30 men were drinking. A disturbance took place at 10 o'clock. There is a suspicion that it was a case of police implicating some one else in the affray, and then killing him.

The defendant in her statement of claim stated that she did not intend to slander plaintiff, but to do him a kindness. The matter was settled out of court. Mr. Gannon asked Mr. Winter if it wasgete to his wife. Defendant's statement of claim was as follows : That since the year 1882 plaintiff's wife was frequently employed in the defendant's hotel in the capacity of a barmaid, and while she was so employed the defendant frequently had reason to believe that the plaintiff was not living with her as his wife ; that plaintiff's wife had a child by him, and at different times he introduced another woman to her as his wife ; that the defendant having heard that plaintiff was living with other woman, in order to injure plaintiff and the defendant gave to the plaintiff's wife, Mrs. M. B. Winter, a letter dated 5th October, 1885, and addressed to her husband, in which the letter the following words were stated to have been inserted: 'Did you give notice to quit? and who is this woman you are living with? Have you got a wife living? Why do you not live at home?' and further the letter contained the following words : ""If you are not living with your wife you ought to be ashamed of yourself ; and, if you are living with another woman, why don't you live at home ? Why do you make a cat and dog of your wife ? I know you do. You are no better than a maniac."" There was a reference to the plaintiff's wife as ""your wife,"" and the plaintiff was no maniac.'

WATER BOARD MEETINGS. GEORGE TOWN, SATURDAY. A letter was read from Mr. Banks, chairman of the Tasmanian Road Board, enclosing copies of certain rates received by his board. The Chairman said the letter was intended to show how a Road Board had to get its funds. One of the rates was a road rate, another was for cobble stone. The latter amounted to 15c per stone per yard, and was assessed at £1 per mile. That was very cheap. If the roads were to be properly laid out, it would be at least £2 per mile. The Board was paying a large amount for the water used at the Council Chambers, the rates being £1350 per annum, but that had been found to be a large amount to pay. If the Government would provide a free supply for that purpose, it would save a good deal of money. The rate for sewerage was 6d per yard per day, which would come to 20c per yard per annum. The sewerage rates had been very low at the Board's last meeting, because they had heard there was an excessive rate for sewerage. They now found that there was only one rate for water and sewerage. The chairman said the Government would have to raise the water rate, and the sewerage rate would have to be increased, because, although the charge for the supply of water and the charge for the removal of sewage was at present very low, there was a loss on the business, and the Board had to charge enough to cover its costs. The Chairman also read a letter from Mr. Gillespie, Commissioner of Crown Lands, enclosing a copy of a report on a petition for a road to be opened to enable a railway to run to the township of Wallsend. The road would be found to be of no use at all, and the cost would be £2200 to £2500. He did not think it was worth while proceeding with the road. The Chairman also read a report on an application to build a road through Mr. W. E. P. Owens' estate, and referred to a communication from Mr. C. P. Owens, which was not before the Board. Mr. W. E. P. Owens also gave a report on the road, stating that a road could be formed through the land on the east side of the river at a cost of £322. In his report, Mr. C. P. Owens said that, if a road were opened, the Board would probably be compelled to build it at the cost of £10,000 or £12,000.

1. In a dispute concerning the value of a certain timber stock of a large timber company, the court decided that, because it was the duty of the court to decide whether it was necessary for the parties to settle the dispute in the same manner as it had been decided that the dispute was not settled in accordance with a contract of the parties, and therefore did not decide whether a sale should be made or a sale not made, the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the High Court, on the grounds that, in the first case, the court had ruled that the party deciding the issue of the value of the stock in question was a private individual, and in the second case, it was a public official, and in both cases it was a matter for the court to decide. The court therefore reversed the decision of the High Court, and ordered the parties to settle the dispute in the same manner as in the first case. The parties then pleaded that, because it was the duty of the court to decide whether a sale should be made or not, it was not necessary for the parties to settle the issue of the value of the timber stock in question, and therefore did not decide whether a sale should be made. They also said that, when the court had decided whether it was necessary for the parties to settle the issue of the value of the timber stock in question, the court had ruled that a sale was not made, because, in the first case, the court had ruled that the parties were parties to the case, and had been able to decide whether or not a sale should be made. The parties had pleaded that the high court had ruled that it was necessary for the parties to settle the issue of the value of the timber stock in question, and therefore the parties did not decide whether or not a sale was made, and therefore the high court did not decide whether or not a sale should be made. The parties further pleaded that the high court had ruled that it was necessary for the parties to settle the issue of the value of the timber stock in question, and therefore the parties decided whether or not a sale was made. They also pleaded that the high court had ruled that it was necessary for the parties to settle the issue of the value of the timber stock in question, and therefore the parties decided whether or not a sale was made.

We know your wife; we do not want any other woman."" This is averred in the summons. The defendant states that Mrs. Lyeart had been introduced to him by Mrs. Walsh, and that she had given to him her name, and was introduced as his wife, but that they had not then come to be married. Plaintiff alleges that the defendant is a married man, and that the said Mrs. Lyeart was a married woman. At the trial a witness testified that Mrs. Lyeart and he had been introduced as husband and wife, and that Mrs. Lyeart, after being introduced, was introduced as the wife of plaintiff. The other witnesses were examined as to their knowledge of the said statement, and as to whether it was true or false, and they all deposed it was not true. The defendant, on the other hand, admitted it to have been his language, but that it was not intended as slander, as it was made in jest. On cross examination it appeared that the defendant was a married man, but that he was not living with his wife at the time the conversation referred to took place. There being no further evidence the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. In re : WILSON. Mr. Loxton, with him Mr. Mason, instructed by Mr. M. Cojrn-n, for plaintiff.

The defendant's contention is that the plaintiff has no right to sue for slander because he was charged with being an impostor. The plaintiff alleges in his defence that he was not guilty of the imp","The jury were instructed to return a verdict for plaintiff. THE TABLES OF THE LAW. INFRACTIBILITY OF CONTRACTS. The Times. The action of Thomas C. Blythe for the infringement of a contract to deliver goods at the cost of £1 2, to the use of the defendant, who had paid only one-fourth of the contract price, was dismissed. The court held that the contract was null and void as it was not in the name of the defendant's real business. The judge stated that he did not think the words 'in the name of' necessary to make the contract enforceable. The contract was made in the name of the defendant's father. There was evidence of several parties, as to the defendant's father, but not as to the defendant. There was evidence as to the defendant's father receiving the goods, and, having paid part of the price, the judge did not think it necessary to make the defendant the agent for paying the other three-fourths of the price. THE TABLES OF THE LAW. The Times. The action of John E. Stacey against James H. P. and George T. Jones was dismissed for want of venue. The action was brought for the sum of £4, for an alleged breach of a promise to employ Stacey as a clerk. A plea of the defence that the plaintiff could not go where it was necessary for him to go, and had not gone, as he had been detained in the colony, was sustained. THE TABLES OF THE LAW. The Times. The action of the trustees of the estate of James D. Lacey for the breach of a contract for the erection of a school, was dismissed. The defendants admitted the contract, but said they did not agree to erect a school, but only to supply some timber. There was evidence that the defendant had supplied some timber, but it was not admitted that it was agreed that it should be the school timber. The judgment was awarded against the defendants. THE TABLES OF THE LAW. The Times. The action of J. H. M. Tompkins against James H. P. and George T. Jones was dismissed for want of venue. The action was for £2 for alleged injury to the plaintiff's property. The defendants pleaded that there was no proof of the damage done to the plaintiff's property, and that it was impossible for the plaintiff to go where he wanted to go, as he had been detained in the colony.

The defendant being then a man of the world and a gentleman, and the plaintiff a very ignorant, poor woman, there was some degree of probability of his finding that he had said some thing which was not true, so it was agreed to try the issue of fact. The jury said they had no evidence on the point, as they had not seen the words alleged, and were not satisfied that they had been said. Mr. Holt said the defendant's argument that he was not entitled to the child or anything else from the plaintiff was not well taken, as it was evident the defendant intended by the words employed to wound and insult the plaintiff, as he was a man of the world, and he might think it a little high-handed on his part to call the plaintiff a woman of a low character, and also that he had introduced a woman to his wife without her consent. He had not proved the facts on which he had alleged the words to have been said. The plaintiff's defence was founded on the plea of slander on the plaintiff's character, and he alleged that he had not spoken such words, and that he would have a jury if they were called, and they ought to be called, to decide the issue. The question was taken as to whether the words alleged to have been spoken were such as would cause the defendant to be annoyed. The answer to that question was in the negative. The jury then asked if they had a duty to call the words alleged to have been said. The answer was in the negative, and they then gave a verdict for the defendant. This was an action to recover damages for defamation by Charles Keen, late merchant and merchant and solicitor to the Crown in this Colony, to J. S. Brown, for having published in the paper called the Sydney Morning Herald a notice of a death, and charging that he had received £20 for the work of his hands for the writing the notice","In the following case, Mr. A.

This a as an action brought by William Hardwicke, deceased, to recover damages for alleged assault, wrongful imprisonment, and false imprisonment of a member of his family, who had been wrongfully imprisoned for twelve days. He alleged that the prisoner had been imprisoned by defendant and the prisoner was a member of the family of the defendant. The prisoner was a servant of the defendant, a butcher, who was a relation of defendant's mother, and the prisoner was an inmate of a laundry kept by defendant. The jury gave a verdict for defendant, adding that he was of opinion that the prisoner, the day he was imprisoned, was not an inmate of the laundry, but of a public house. Mr. T. T. Holt said, "" I wish to call your attention to a point that was raised by Mr. C. M. C. Scott, the learned counsel for defendant. I have not thought it necessary to repeat my comments thereupon, but I may remind the jury of the law that it is the duty of the prisoner to give his consent to his own detention before being taken into custody. If the prisoner consents to his own detention before his arrest, he may then be detained in the jail; but if he does not consent to his own detention before his arrest, he may be detained in the jail, but not for the time of his arrest."" Mr. J. W. Thomson said, that he should have preferred to deal with this matter differently, and that the question in the jury verdict was a very important one, as it meant that a prisoner may be detained in jail for the whole time of his arrest. Mr. J. W. Thomson, in reply, said, "" The fact of a prisoner consenting to be kept in jail at the time of his arrest would, of course, mean that he would be detained at the jail. It is quite possible that he might have consented to be detained in the jail at the time of his arrest and yet afterwards have been allowed to go out again. I am not sure that this matter of consent has not already been discussed in some cases, and I am not sure that it has not been decided in certain cases that if a prisoner has consented to his own detention before his arrest he may, under certain",BLOOM-7.1B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-7b1.jsonl,0.917519566526189,0.24946004319654427,-0.7281147429465485,80-99%,0.9197884530630234,0.2607758620689655,-0.7164827834046561,80-99%,-0.7152463332965908,Negative Improvement,444,384,Derevyanko and his father had installed on the territory of,0.9074074074074074,0.2711864406779661,-0.701141473538568,80-99%,14316000 year 1900 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 14316000,,,,,,limited

No. 3 JURY COURT. (Before Mr. Justice Denning and juries of four.) CLAIM AGAINST A PATRON. R. v. E. (Dickey) C. The plaintiff was a man of 35, the defendant was a man of 22, both living in the county of Kerry. The plaintiff was employed as a gardener at a hotel in the county of Kerry; and the defendant was employed as a porter in the same hotel. On the 27th of January last, the plaintiff called on the defendant and had a long conversation concerning his wife, and in particular about the death of her. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had advised the deceased to tell his wife to put off child-bearing till she could get out of this country. The defendant, not answering for himself, the evidence of the witnesses, and the advice of the coroner, pleaded not guilty. The evidence of the witnesses was that on the night of the 25th of January the deceased and the defendant were out, and that on the night of the 28th of January the deceased was in the room of the defendant, when he saw him enter the room of his wife. The plaintiff said that on that night he saw the defendant leave the room, and when he went to the door he found the door was fastened. The evidence was that on the day of the murder the deceased, when his wife was in the parlour, sat on the window-seat, and the deceased heard two sounds, the first sound being the ringing of a bell, and the second sound being the step of two persons. The defendant said the second sound was a door being opened, and when he went out he saw the window open and the plaintiff in the parlour. The defendant said he had not heard the sound of the bell before. In evidence the plaintiff produced a photograph of his wife which had been taken on the evening before the murder. The evidence of the witnesses was that they had never been married. The evidence was that on the evening before the murder the defendant and the deceased had been together, that they had talked a good deal, and that the defendant had left the room about eleven o'clock. The witness said the deceased had left the room about eleven o'clock and went into the parlour, where he had sat until twelve o'clock, and had never left the parlour till after twelve o'clock. The witness said he heard two sounds, the first being the ringing of the bell, and the second being the step of two persons, which he described as the step of a man and a woman walking into the room. The witness said he heard the step of the defendant before he saw him. The witness said he had never seen the defendant since then, and the witness said if the defendant had been at the hotel that night he could not have stayed there and talked to the deceased. The witness said he could not identify the person standing by the defendant on that night, and he could only identify the other person who stood there.

This was brought by Judge T. T. Smith at a plea of a libel and slander suit against defendant, and, while the court had decided to consider whether the matter raised by the plaintiff was in fact a matter of libel, this matter was to be heard and decided by the jury of three. The trial was adjourned until March 21st, and the defendant was acquitted of all but two charges on all points. On appeal the case to the High Court was then thrown out. Mr. Thomson and his attorneys tried to persuade the court of the propriety of the trial before it. The case was heard in the High Court. The jury was very much interested in whether the plaintiff had a son or daughter or a child. The jury decided that, if a child was present in any case, there was no reason to believe that the plaintiff was incapable of giving them a child at birth and no reason to believe that the plaintiff should have one at any time, the defendant being found guilty of all six counts. The defendant was found guilty of all six counts of which the jury were ordered to find on the plea of a libel. On the motion of the plaintiff to suppress the evidence the jury did so by removing the evidence by order of the court which contained the following statement: ""There was, before the trial, an affidavit which was made by Mr. J. N. Rolle, a former employee of the defendant, that Mr. Rolle was the agent of the defendant, who said that he was under the control of the defendant. At that time, Mr. Rolle did not have any agent for the defendant, who was under the control of the defendant, and at that time, under the control of the defendant, was not a member of the defendant's class. But the affidavit also stated, that Mr. Rolle had acted as agent in order to take part in an action against the plaintiff, which was later discovered to have taken place on behalf of the defendant, which had not been taken from the defendant. Mr. Rolle had never spoken to the defendant before at the time of the case; he had not been present during the trial on the day of the trial, or on the day before the trial."" In a motion made by Mr. Thomson, he said: "" The plaintiff's daughter, Alexander, was present at the trial.

The other woman claimed she did know the baby but had not seen it, nor heard anything of the plaintiff.

Plaintiff in cross-examination said, he had been asked, "" who are those two women with the child?"", and he said he had said the wife was Mrs. M., and the child was called Henry. A witness on cross-examination said that he had not seen Henry, and that he never heard of any such woman in his life, except in the witness' own family. Another witness, on cross-examination said that he had never seen Miss M., and had never heard of such a woman. This witness said that if there were any mistake about Miss M. then there could not have been any mistake about Henry. The plaintiff's evidence was that he knew of the birth of Henry by the witness, and knew of the birth of Henry by the witness, who was a friend of the plaintiff's and the witness', mother. A witness, Mr. J. W. T. S. B., gave his evidence as follows, that he had no record of the birth of Henry, and that he never saw a baby named Henry. The defendant's evidence was that he had never heard of a baby called Henry. Plaintiff said, he thought there was no mistake about Miss M., because there was nothing in the witness's or his mother's statement about Henry. The witness said he never had any misgivings about Miss M. or about Henry. The witness said that Miss M. did not know anything about the birth of Henry, and that he was perfectly certain that it was not Miss M. who gave birth to Henry.

The plaintiff, after the defendant had failed to show any evidence to justify this motion it was sent for an order to hear the evidence on behalf of plaintiff. After hearing it the court ordered the plaintiff to furnish and sign a declaration of debt which he has already paid to the court, stating he has no reason to believe that he was or has been indebted for work done, materials supplied, etc. Mr. Gannon had been previously instructed by Mr. Balser that there was no need to do that in the present case. The defendant had not shown to the court in this proceeding any evidence to justify that contention. It was, and is, the judgment of the court that the suit was proved for breach of a contract between plaintiff and defendant. The trial court, seeing the record at the close of the jury's examination, ordered the jury to deliberate according to the opinion of Judge Martin (Thess. v. Orr, in 1867). Mr. J. F. Orr, with Mr. W. Balser and Mr. B. D. Brown, directed by Mr. Gannon, to have the trial judge enter a decision which is as yet pending. It is to be observed, that Judge Martin, in his opinion for the defendant, having no occasion for deliberation of his opinion in this court, is entitled to the power of writing to the judge, for the purpose of entering an opinion of a final judgment. Mr. Gannon was ordered by Judge Martin to enter upon the judgment in this proceeding and have the jury examine a copy of the judgment and the jury make their decisions in this case according to his opinion.

LyeaRht h idle, licensee of the Revolving Battery Hotel, Woolloomooloo, for alleged slander conveyed to plaintiff's wife, to whom, according to the declina- tion defendant had said words to the effect that plaintiff had introduced to the defendant another woman as pliiliitiU's wife, and that the other woman had a baby with her of which they plaintiff had said, "" Don't you think it is like me i"" It was also complained by plaintiff that defendant had advised plaintiff's wife for telling her this information to les re plaintiff as he was not north living with, and had told her that he must! get a maintenance order against the plaintiff. In consequence plaintiff said he was injured in his credit and rent it, and was for some time in debt to this creditor and to his friend, who, to his annoyance, was in debt to this creditor and to his friend, but he was not in an ill-feeling condition at all, and was not in breach of the mortgage, nor had any other debts been caused against him. The plaintiff now proceeded on the plaintiff's motion to have the damages fixed, and in its stead brought up the question to be resolved, that by law the creditor or the borrower should recover damages to the plaintiff from the defendant's negligence. In consequence plaintiff said he did not believe this, and felt at once that his negligence did more harm than good, and that the creditor should be liable for the plaintiff's harm and the damage suffered by his wife in return for the plaintiff's mis-doing of his obligations, and for the loss of the estate. He thought plaintiff did not need much persuasion on his side, and that it was his duty to take him to trial, and he would not allow this to be attempted with such force as could not be brought at court. In consequence plaintiff said he had suffered much damage to his wife's credit, that the creditor should have his money paid at the time he entered into his judgment, that this was the whole matter of which the jury, with their usual pre-judgment judgment, was to hear, and that he knew he should go on without any remedy to this breach of his covenant. He believed in all he said, that all in his charge, whether by oath or by telegram, had acted and acted. The plaintiff had no reason to believe in his negligence, because he knew what he was doing; and that if his judgment had been not reversed as before, plaintiff would have never had his property of which he was a party, and that he would not have been able to keep any money or money which he was not a party to, and he would not have had his name and place of residence, his name, and place of business as a party and person of his party.

Garnham, instructed by Mr. K. F. Sherriff, for plaintiff ; Mr. F. H. Kettle, instructed by Mr. T. B. Lewis, for defendant. In this action the plaintiff sued the defendant for an alleged false representation. The case was a short one. The plaintiff was a shareholder in a company known as the Permanent Investment Trusts, Ltd., whose object was to provide, for persons who wished to invest their money, permanent income out of free-holds which the company should buy. In pursuance of this object the plaintiff and other shareholders, in accordance with the regulations of the company, placed in the hands of the trustees certain sums, being respectively, 5,000, 1,000, and 1,000 shares, and the trustees purchased for the plaintiff a free-hold in the City, for which he paid £105. The company at the time issued a circular, with an illustration, stating that free-holds were bought from time to time for about £10,000. This is the charge of fraud and deceit. The plaintiff's claim was to recover £200, representing what he had spent in fees on the conveyancing, but he was not willing to accept the sum. The defendant's case was that the statement was an illustration and was not intended to be a statement of the actual value of the free-hold, but of its value at the time the circular was issued. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.

The jury retired. The jury returned verdicts for the defendant, the damages assessed at £5. CARAVANNAS IN SYDNEY. It is reported that three caravanas are about to come to Sydney. It is expected that the accommodation provided in them will be of a superior character to that afforded by the existing caravans in the colony, and that they will give scope for more comfortable living to the traveller. One of the caravans will be fitted up as a private residence, and the two others will be occupied by parties of different nationalities. The last two are to be sent to Sydney, and will arrive in about three months. It is expected that the accommodation provided by the caravans will be much more expensive than that given by the ordinary caravans, but they will be comfortable.

The defendant denied the allegations of the declaration, and maintained that the words used had been substantially, if not literally, true. A verdict of the plaintiff was given. In the course of the summing up the learned Judge, in reply to a question, said he could not see that the allegation made against plaintiff was, as a slander, defamatory of his character or profession, for there could be no doubt that he was a policeman ; and it was for the jury to say whether the defendant intended to slander the plaintiff in the particular instance of the charge to which attention had been drawn by the learned Judge. The verdict of the jury was, that the defendant had been libelled. Mr. Loxton said that the question of fact in the case was, who had said what ? If it was proved that the defendant had said that the plaintiff had introduced another woman to him, as his wife, and that the defendant had said to the plaintiff's wife, "" You have been deceived ; your husband has been deceiving you ; you have a child by the man with whom you are living, and I know where he has got the child,"" then the case had gone far enough to support the plaintiff. The defendant had no intention to slander the plaintiff ; he meant what he said, and the alleged insinuation of the defendant was not intended by the defendant to be libellous ; there had been a breach of faith between the parties, and the defendant had taken steps to discover the facts, and the defendant's wife was a lady of honour and character, and the allegations that the child belonged to her husband, who was a married man, were true, and the defendant did not intend to slander the plaintiff. After hearing argument, his Honor, Mr. Justice Ridley, upheld the defence, and gave the following judgment:—"" If, as the learned Judge said, it had not been a civil action for slander, but a criminal prosecution against the defendant for an indictable offence, I should have been quite of","SINGLE MOTOR CAR COMPANY. (Before Mr. Justice Stephen, and a jury.) Hearley v. Lister. This was an action for infringement of a patent of 1898 for the use of an internal combustion engine in a cycle and lighting. machine. In this case it was contended that the use of such an engine in a cycle and lighting machine was an infringement of patent No. 45353, and the defendant denied infringement, and set up the defences under Section 68, paragraph (k). Mr. F. Lester, instructed by Mr. H. K. O'Sullivan, for the plaintiff, said the patent was for the use of an internal combustion engine for driving a cycle and lighting machine. That was an improvement in the motor cycle, and was intended to avoid the vibration and trouble caused by the ordinary machine, by which the frame and handle- bars were made to shake. The defendant's machine was a single cylinder, and had one fixed shaft which drove the rear wheel and the rear lighting lamps, which shaft was mounted on the engine. The ordinary engine had two fixed shafts, one driving the rear wheel and the other the lighting lamp. He contended that there was an infringement of the patent. Mr. C. A. Cutler, instructed by Mr. R. P. Martin, defended on behalf of the defendant, and said that the plaintiff's patent was for the invention of a machine for driving a cycle or other vehicle by a reciprocating engine, and had nothing to do with single motor carriages, which was not an article of the Patents definition. He denied that the defendant's machine was an infringement of the plaintiff's patent. The jury retired about three o'clock on Monday afternoon to consider their verdict, but after an absence of nearly four hours they returned to say that they were unable to agree. The court re- sumed, and after a further absence of half an hour they again returned with the same verdict. Mr. Justice Stephen said he could not send the case to a second jury, and would not discharge them, but he would dismiss the action. The case was dismissed with costs. The plaintiff was non-suited.

The court held that plaintiff had done in good faith, that a number of the facts were sufficient to constitute a crime of seduction and, therefore, a charge of false pretence. The court found that plaintiff had been married to Mr. Orrock, a person whoায়েed the estate of Alexander Orrock, and had married the plaintiff's wife, and there was no evidence that Mr. Orrock had consented to her deceiving him, and that he had ever tried toینیا the other defendant, that menjabat he did so in order to get relief in the case. He had had sex with her at her place of business on the 8th October, when she and the plaintiff were together and the plaintiff's husband was there, and the defendant's wife gave him a letter stating that it was an order of the county council to return her the money paid, and that the defendant could not be held liable because of the money sent for funeral expenses. The defendant pleaded not guilty, the court found the plaintiff guilty. The court said plaintiff had shown that the defendant had intended to make a good faith effort to avoid his wife's deceit by convincing her that he was not well pleased with her, and that he had never tried to cheat the defendant, and that he had had sex with her at her place of business on the 8th October, when she and the defendant were together and the defendant's wife was there and the defendant was unwell. The defendant pleaded not guilty. The court found that plaintiff had shown that the defendant had intended to make a good faith effort to avoid his wife's deceit by convincing her that he was not well pleased with her, and that he had never tried to cheat the defendant, and that he had had sex with her at the place of business, where she and the plaintiff were at the same time in possession of one another.

The plaintiff must be a proper party and that his claim must be just, and he must show that the defendant wronged him or did him any wrong, and that the defendant was guilty of a tortious act or omission which was the proximate cause of his damages.

Mr. Mason, with him Mr. Gannon, instructed by Mr. Mason, appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. J. A. Holt, for defendant. Mr. Loxton said the case was to decide whether the property known as the "" Land of Johnson's Farm,"" situated between North- road and the North Shore of Parramatta, was the property of Joseph Jackson, deceased, and if so, whether it was the property of his widow, or of his daughter, Mrs. B. Jackson, plaintiff, or his nephews, W. and B. Jackson, defendant s. Plaintiff's case was that she had a conveyance from Joseph Jackson in which he gave his daughter, Mary Ann, in consideration for which the property was conveyed to her, in trust for his widow, but she did not know about the conveyance, and she was suing the estate of the deceased, the widow of Joseph Jackson, for the property, because it was for her mother's interest. The defendant's case was that no such conveyance was in existence, and that her claim to it was a scalded plea. In the absence of the parties, the case was adjourned until the next day. The land is in the north-west of Parramatta, about 2 1/2 miles from the junction of the north and east roads, and about 7 miles from North Road. JANUARY, 1876. The LAND OF JOHNSON'S FARM. Tewitt v.

The defendant called witnesses, but only Mr. Mason appeared. It is alleged that he had seen in defendant's office letters, and had been called on to sign papers. It is also alleged that he was in conversation with a gentleman, and he told Mr. Mason he had received letters from defendant. On cross-examination by counsel the plaintiff, Mr. Mason said he could not have the letters because the defendant himself kept the letters. The defence were cross-examined, and it appeared that they were the only witnesses, and the defendant stated that he would not give them to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was defended by Mr. M. M.

The letters were delivered to the plaintiff after the trial, and the plaintiff's counsel requested to be delivered of them in writing. The prisoner says he could not do so.

This is a matter of contention between the parties, not a cause of law for the court. The jury did not find that the text had been tampered with, and the jury decided the matter. The jury is not required to take any actions in the event of any dispute that may arise between the parties. See, e.g., v. Gannett, 3d 6th Edd. 441, 481 n. 9 (Miss. 1967) (concluding in an order that ""it is impossible to take any action that may result in the invalidity of any property in respect to which the court finds that there is a right or privilege under the act or omission of which it has made a decision,"" for a judgment in favor of plaintiff on this or any other matter. It is apparent, however, that the fact that defendant was not liable for the negligence of defendant does not mean that defendant was not liable. In sum, a matter of the present time cannot be resolved in the manner the parties have been able to devise, and it is entirely impossible for the parties to reach a settlement, even in a court of law, which will provide for trial on the same ground as that in which the jury has been asked to proceed. See, e.g., 442 U.S. at 783 (discussing that Court's own ""no pre- decision or conclusion or judgment"" when dealing with a civil action as to the validity of property for which the court has no jurisdiction) (citing Court's opinion in U.S. v.

On the knit of Mr. W. M. Lyle v. T. K. R. Moore.

Mr. F. Lyle v. M. C. P. Worthel, and for the plaintiff, was of opinion that, while the plaintiff was not entitled to relief from damages, the defendants could, if they had a court order, bring a suit against plaintiff as a defendant. He said that in the event of a case arising under section 921.2, the action should be brought by a court or an authority, but the plaintiff was not entitled to relief from damages. The defendant had the right to commence proceedings in the name of the person who brought the suit against him as a defendant, but the plaintiff had no right to bring a lawsuit on his behalf. The plaintiff also made a request for judgment that Mr. Lyle should not be brought to trial.

Mr. Lyle v. M. C. P. Worthel. This is a case brought by a former employee of a firm where he had worked for twenty years. This complaint was brought against the defendant, on the basis that the plaintiff was employed in the building industry. Mr. Lyle, who is now deceased, was employed by Mr. Moore, who is now deceased. He told his father that he was fired because of a bad accident, and that he had to take time to recover it. In order to recover damages, the plaintiff had to take a time course of work. The suit was brought in the following manner: Mr. Moore v. F. O. M. O. (H.) Lyle, was of opinion that it was the right of the defendant to bring his suit under sections 921.2, 921.2.1, 921.2.2.1 and 921.2.2.1. The plaintiff did not want to proceed at this time to trial, and he had to proceed in the course of his work with Mr. Moore. In the event, he went to the court for review of the order of a court, and there he was granted a stay.

Thomson, instructed by Mr. F. Norrie, appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. T. Keam, instructed by Mr. L. Levy, for, the defendant. This was a suit by Michael Walsh to recover £312 12s. 10d. from Charles Orrock, defendant, as administrator of the estate of Alexander Orrock, deceased, intestate. The money claimed was for work done, materials provided, funeral expenses, board, lodging, washing, and attendance for deceased, goods sold and delivered, &c., and money lent and paid, and interest thereon. The defence urged that defendant and the deceased Alexander Orrock were never indebted as alleged. The jury gave a verdict for the defendant, adding a rider that it is of opinion that the undertaker's account should be wholly paid out of the estate, and if the plaintiff had paid anything to the undertaker for the funeral the undertaker should refund him. Mr. Holt said the defendant had already asked to have the undertaker's account sent to him for settlement, and the plaintiff also alleged a further claim of £23 3s. 7d. for money lent to deceased and interest thereon, and a claim of
£104 15s. 2d. as value of goods sold and delivered to the deceased. The defence was that the said amount of money lent and paid was advanced by the defendant for the deceased, and that the goods sold and delivered were purchased for the deceased. The case is part heard.

Incorrect text: defence urns that defendant and the deceased Alexander
The corrected text is:","In response to the evidence, the jury concluded that there was not any evidence to support the defendant's claims against plaintiff. The defence's defence urns indicated that the defendant had paid the plaintiff money. However, the jury did not allow for an acquittal, and it did not allow for a defendant's liability to the plaintiff. Mr. Gannon was not convicted of the claim under the lawsuit, but he was convicted of his reliance on a false claim. The defence urns stated that Mr. Gannon had not made any representations that the plaintiff was a stranger to the estate, and that he was not aware that the plaintiff had used a false claim to gain custody of the defendant's wife. He was not aware of his wife's condition of health, nor of the fact that the plaintiff had not made a complaint to police for a broken leg.
The defence also alleged that the plaintiff had failed to disclose to the court whether the defendant had not paid money to the undertaker for the funeral expenses, and whether the plaintiff had used an unfounded complaint to police for the plaintiff's broken leg. The jury rejected the defence's allegations of unlawfully relying on a false claim to gain custody of the plaintiff's wife. Mr. Gannon was convicted of reliance on false claims.
The jury also found that Mr. Gannon had not disclosed to the court that the plaintiff was a stranger to the estate and that Mr. Gannon had failed to disclose that the plaintiff had used a false claim to gain custody of the defendant's wife.

The plaintiff in the above cases has been discharged by this Court. The parties plead that they are perfectly aware that the defendant is not an Australian resident, and that it is not the intent of this Court to sanction the practice of the plaintiffs, which they are aware have been going on with the defendant since June last, and which, after the trial, they intend to continue. The defendant has made a number of applications, both by letter and personally, to the Court, for the plaintiffs to be reinstated on the ground that they were not permitted to practise the law in Australia in accordance with the Act of 1907, and on the basis of these applications he has obtained a judicial decree. The plaintiffs have in the meantime, before the Court, shown a written application to this Court for reinstatement, which they say has been accepted as a genuine application by the Court, that their practice of the law in Australia is in accordance with the law of Australia, and that they can show that they are Australian residents, although they are not Australian nationals. The parties agree that it is not the intent of this Court to sanction the practice of the plaintiffs. We cannot enter into the application. We are of the opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to practise their profession, and we are satisfied that there is no question that the plaintiffs practise the law in accordance with the law of Australia. They were able to procure, at a small expense, the services of an Australian lawyer, who has been practising in Australia for some time, but who is no longer a resident of Australia.

THOUGH
the evidence is only in the words of the witnesses and no evidence of their demeanour was elicited, the evidence is sufficient to show that, between the 1st and the 3rd of March 1879, defendant (Dr Moir) was guilty of the following offences:
1. He caused goods sold to defendant (the plaintiff) to be sold again by defendant (Dr Moir).
2. He caused defendant (Dr Moir) to be employed to deliver the goods to the defendant (the plaintiff).
3. He caused defendant (Dr Moir) to sell the goods at a price which defendant (the plaintiff) was not required to pay.
It was clear that the defendant (Dr Moir) had a desire to defraud defendant (the plaintiff). The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that the goods sold by the defendant (Dr Moir) to defendant (the plaintiff) were for defendant (the plaintiff)'s account. The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that defendant (the plaintiff) was entitled to receive goods at the price agreed upon. The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that defendant (the plaintiff) had not paid defendant (Dr Moir) for the goods. It appears that the defendant (Dr Moir) intended to defraud defendant (the plaintiff). The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that the goods would not be delivered at the price agreed upon unless defendant (the plaintiff) paid defendant (Dr Moir). It is not necessary to prove that defendant (Dr Moir) had a desire to defraud defendant (the plaintiff) in order to convict defendant (Dr Moir) of the offence of causing defendant (the plaintiff) to be employed to deliver the goods to defendant (the plaintiff). The evidence is sufficient to show that defendant (Dr Moir) had the intention to defraud defendant (the plaintiff). The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that defendant (the plaintiff) would not receive the goods unless he paid defendant (Dr Moir). The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that he could avoid giving the plaintiff goods at the price agreed upon by giving defendant (the plaintiff) goods for which defendant (Dr Moir) was not required to pay.

CONCERTS IN THE PRESENT JURISDICTION
The Court decided the cases against Mr. P S Darnell, of Hartnell, and Mr. H. H. Johnson, of Hartnell, for breach of contract in respect of the sale of coal for the purchase of condit oil, and a verdict was given for Mr. Johnson. The Court concluded by the payment of an interest on the sum paid for the sale of coal for the purchase of condit oil. The Company was not bound to pay the sum to Mr. Johnson; he was therefore compensated. The Company was then liable for £25,000, to the plaintiff for the loss incurred.</s>",BLOOM-560M,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl,1.0,0.1951219512195122,-0.8048780487804879,99-100%,0.9466666666666667,0.30952380952380953,-0.6730382293762576,80-99%,-0.760931442312411,Negative Improvement,216,346,-la falta de info que le falta al link de,1.0,0.1951219512195122,-0.8048780487804879,99-100%,13922000 year 1893 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 13922000,,,,,,limited

This was a claim by Joseph and Mary Smith, of 2 Globe-street, Paddington, against Samuel E. A. Haines, of 0-t-3 Globe-street, Sydney, for £10 12s, said deeds of settlement to be executed at Sydney, Australia, before this Court, and for £10 12s in the sum of £10 6c. He was an officer of the Commonwealth of Australia in the employ of the United States government, and by no means a wealthy man. His business was to obtain coal and timber, as well as to supply food, and to give to the United States at present, and to continue for a period of several years, a service of £5 6s 7d per annum. His business was limited to obtaining timber, timber, and timber, but his possessions were not substantial enough to afford him much security. There was no interest in his estates for more than twenty years; and he was not able to make his monthly repayments. Mr. Haines, as an officer of the United States government, made a general payment of £20,000 to the United States, but he only had the money as a deposit. This interest of the United States was then repayed. He was no more prosperous than when he left the United States, but his income was very poor, and he was unable to support himself for a long time. He was forced, upon losing his income, to take the action for £20,000, a sum which he was unable to pay. Mr. Haines then took a very large sum of money from Mr. Smith, and paid it to Mr. Smith's friend at the time Mr. Smith, as the lawyer, was called to give evidence at Mr. Smith's trial. This payment of money was to be paid to Mr. Smith, on a monthly basis, for the remaining period of the loan. Mr. Smith, as the lawyer, was charged with being the owner of the land on which the land was situated. Mr. Smith had an interest in this land, and in his contract with Mr. Haines he paid him £25 6s. 6d per annum for the remainder of the loan. Mr. Haines then took a large sum of money from Mr. Smith, and paid it to Mr. Smith's friend at the time of Mr. Smith's trial, a sum which Mr. Smith was unable to pay. Mr. Haines, therefore, obtained a personal guarantee against Mr. Smith and the land on which Mr. Smith was situated, for the entire amount due on the loan. This amount was paid out of Mr. Smith's pocket. Mr. Haines had also made the money payable to Mr. Smith in his name, and the agreement of which was to be in writing. He was entitled to the sum of £10 6s. 6d per annum for the remaining period of the loan.

I don't know why you didn't say this in the instructions but if you look at the previous example, you can tell that in both cases you want the sentences to be indented. However, it is up to the students to notice the differences. 
You could say something like: 

We are correcting your texts and are waiting for you to finish the work. Please make sure the sentences are indented and that you are using the correct punctuation for each sentence.

If you have used a dictionary and found an error, make sure you write the word down on your answer sheet before correcting it.
You could also ask a question to the class like

Why did you do it like this? What do you think can be done?

You could give students a few examples. Students could make suggestions, but you shouldn't correct the errors right away and you shouldn't tell them exactly what to do.
The students can do the work in their own time. They could write it down, or they could do it in a file. If you don't want the students to have a file, then you can tell them to do the work on the answer sheet and ask them to write it down before sending it in. 
I suggest you give the students one to three days. It is possible that you can complete the task in one day, but it is harder if you have more than one student. You could also tell them that they could do it faster if they were in a smaller class.

This case was called upon for the first time and the following Court of Justice sat. HONORABLE THE RIGHT HON. E. ROSS, Judge, and Justice S. H. HANSLEY. The plaintiff, John A. Tredgold, of Wellesbourne, N. S. A. C. G. R., commenced a claim in behalf of George B. Turner, of Wellesbourne, against Wellesbourne Livery Company for goods sold and delivered. Mr Justice HANSLEY appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. Mr Justice CROCKER appeared on behalf of the defendant. The Court resumed its sitting. Mr Justice ROSS spoke on behalf of the Court, and made the following observations:-The whole case is an interesting one to-day. The defendants, who may possibly be of the same name as the plaintiff, have taken the matter up by the action of their friends Mr Turner and Mr Lydgate. They will have a great many friends in this Court. I do not expect to see anything of the kind again. The present Court will have no difficulty in deciding the question in my judgment. The action commenced about the middle of last year and the complaint is made, that Mr Turner sold the goods at a lower price to Mr Lydgate than the price charged by Mr Turner. Mr Turner was accused of being a cheat, but Mr Lydgate was not accused of being a cheat. Mr Lydgate was a general salesman. The whole action arose out of the sale of two horses. They have been said to have sold the horses a few days apart. But no man has ever been accused of being a cheat in a case of this kind. There were several things about the whole case. The first was the fact that the horses were sold to Mr Turner by a man called Mr Lydgate who was not connected with the case.",BLOOM-3B,prompt_basic_02,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-3b.jsonl,1.0,0.16129032258064516,-0.8387096774193549,99-100%,0.9466666666666667,0.2514743049705139,-0.7343581285522741,80-99%,-0.8039258277969946,Negative Improvement,449,346,om -Nesoteles -Neo-NeoNeoNeoNeo,1.0,0.16129032258064516,-0.8387096774193549,99-100%,13922000 year 1893 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 13922000,,,,,,limited

A verdict was given for the plaintiff for the amount claimed. The Court then adjourned. THE CRIMINAL COURTS. (Before the Honourable Mr Justice MacPherson, for the District of New South Wales, and the Honourable Mr Justice King, for the District of Queensland). -ROBERTS V. LONDON, RICHARDSON V. MANSERV, and MARTIN V. ALLEN were tried on Tuesday, before Mr Justice MacPherson, in the Court of Criminal Sessions at Parramatta, and were found guilty of the murder of Wm. C. Roberts, of Paddington. The sentence was death. The Court also found Robert Richardson, Henry Robinson, and Charles Martin, guilty of the murder of Thomas Mason, of George-street, Parramatta, and of assisting the said murder, and the sentence was death. The trial of the three prisoners had been continued until to-day. A few minutes after nine the prisoners were brought into the Court, and it was the first time since their imprisonment that they had been seen in public. They wore cuffs round their arms, and black coats over their shoulders. When they had been taken up to the bar the Court was thrown into a profound silence, and the three prisoners, the same as in their last trial, were taken into custody. -At 9.30 the Court was again crowded, and the attention of the crowded Court, and of the vast assemblage of spectators, was attracted by the entrance of George Mitchell, and by the examination which he made of John Latham, who is one of the prosecution witnesses. George Mitchell and Latham left the Court together, the Court being again thrown into a profound silence, and the prisoners were again taken up to the bar. During the examination Latham gave the names of four persons who had seen Mitchell after the robbery of the stage. Mitchell said, he had met George Mitchell twice; once he had spoken to him for five or six minutes, and the second time for seven minutes. After he had been examined Latham was taken up into custody and taken to the Police-station. The prisoner Mitchell and the three others were then taken up, and in the absence of the Court were again taken into custody and taken to the police-station. At 9.45 Mr Justice King returned, and the three prisoners were again taken up into custody, and the trial was adjourned until to-morrow morning at 10. 30. Mr J. S. Treloar was in attendance in the Court as solicitor for the prosecution. The Attorney General, Mr H. B. Willis, also appeared.

Risley v WHEREAS Bigge asked in 1827 that plural voting in the selection of members of Parliament should be allowed; WHEREAS this request was rejected then; Whereas the country has sixty years * experience of the disadvantageous effects of our parliamentary voting which was established previosuly to the Australian Colonies being federated; WHEREAS in 1880 small political inequalities in the twelve colonies ha^ve led to substantial injustice; Now this petition of the Australians Citizens' League being in the same spirit that governed Bigge's action, but with far more evidence to support its claims, WE, THE UNDERSIGNED PETITIONERS, DO THEREFORE CALLED UPON THE FEDERATED PARLIA^ MENT OF AUSTRALIA TO CONSIDER THE NEW PROPOSALS MADE BY THIS CITIZENS' LEAGUE TO CORRECT THE MISTAKEN WAYS AND INSTITUTIONS OF PAST GENERATIONS.
 IN SUGGESTING AND LEGISLATING FOR SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS NOW FACING US; The action proposed is: Major Constitutional changes: Election or appointment of two or more as opposed to one representative for each electorate; Election or appointment of two or more electors to vote as individuals in the constituency where they reside, not by party lists; Transfer to the EXECUTIVE of all law making authority; The vesting of sole power to make all legislation, which is no longer constitutional, in the People themselves, operating through personal communica­tion, petitions, referenda and Parliamentary committees.

CORRECTED TEXT:","The shipwrights of the city of Sydney are fully aware of the advantages of the compressed air dredging and, in fact, their machinery is employed at a large expen. sive in the various dock-yards. This has been a feature in the works at Newcastle Harbour since the beginning of the present year, where it has been employed to a great extent in the workings on the outer side of the wharves, and particularly along the side towards the quay. It will be seen from the accompanying drawing that it is fitted with a differential clutch, which is capable of transmitting its force without breaking. The driving pulley is situated at the end, and the power transmitted to the ladder is a very trifling matter, as it is transmitted without any force being exerted on the lower part of the chain or rope, and, consequently, without the chance of wear. This system is entirely different from that which is commonly employed in dredging with juncker-ropes, as it does not require any gearing to effect the necessary transmission of force, and therefore the mechanism is simple and easy to construct. We believe it will also be found that in dredging on the inner side of the wharves the use of a differential clutch will greatly increase the economy and speed of operation, as, owing to the extreme weight of the dredged material, the ordinary rope system will be found unable to do the work, and will soon become so heavy that the dredge will become inoperable.
The use of compressed air in dredging the outer wharves of Newcastle Harbour has already been found extremely satisfactory, and we feel confident that if the method of operation were to be adopted in the inner wharves of the same harbour it would prove equally as successful. The following is the result of an experiment made by Messrs. C. R. and Co., Ltd., of the use of a compressed air dredge on the inner side of the Circular Quay, which is a feature of the new harbour, and of which the following drawings give a very satisfactory account:--

The apparatus employed in the experiment consisted of a large cylinder of compressed air with a capacity of 400 cubic feet, a pair of revolving pumps, a cylinder of the same air, and a pair of differential clutches. The water pump was of a very small size, and of an almost negligible power, but was sufficient for the purpose for which it was intended. The dredge, consisting of two sets of revolving cylinders, one on the lower and one on the upper end of the machine, the revolving cylinders being of the same air, was capable of revolving very rapidly, and, when properly adjusted, could accomplish dredging with about four feet of water a minute. The dredge was fitted with revolving cylinders which could be depressed by the water pump, or drawn up by the power of the differential clutches. The water pump was mounted so as to be free from friction, and its cylinder was fitted with a small cylinder of the air. The dredging power was in the ratio of about four to one, and, owing to the great difference in the density of the air and the water, and to the power of the differential clutches, the speed with which the dredge could be moved was sufficient for the operation of the dredge for any required depth.
The apparatus employed in this experiment is very similar to that described by Mr. K. M. Hall (_Journal of the Society of Arts_, vol","segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

IMPROVEMENTS IN. SYDNEY OdP{ Business people and others familiar with the cream.! the steam dredge and other appliances used in connect with deepening operations on the eastern side of CiS Quay will, doubtless, be glad to learn that the wÄ been completed. The work has been in progress about Z yours. It will be remembered that the building Z three sections of now wharfs was finished about in or 12 months ago, two of the 8eetl(m8 v.: about 600 feet in length, and the other (the conttah m feet. Opposite the wharf it has been necessary to soenrV. depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides. For some time past attention has been devoted to that portion of the Syd Cove which is bounded on the east by the central seoUoocr the wharf. It has been accessory to blast and dredge to rock in some places to a depth of 10 foot. The work has not been continuous, having been carried on only as opportunity would allow, otherwise it would, doubtless have been completed much sooner. Serious induction was caused during the wool season in consequence of shire being berthed in that part of the harbour, a Mr spondent, who writes above the signature of ""Liner oneed,"" attributes - the delay to the character of the machinery employed. He expresses it as his conviction that it is of an antiquated description and"" urges that if the Government had imported from Melbourne one of Ford's Compressed Air Rock. borers, and other appliances of a modern character the wwk would have been expedited, and a con-' siderable saving effected. The correspondent referred to also thinks that the appointment of a harbour trait would lead to the more satisfactory carrying out of harbour improvements. We have caused inquiries to be made about the recommendations contained in to letter, and have learnt that it is considered that the machinery which has been employed was the most suitable for the purpose. The rock which had to be removed was irregular and patchy, and consisted of a loft kind of sandstone. Had there been a large mass of coin rock to be operated upon, steam drills could have been employed with advantage; but it was thought that the ""juniper"" was the most suitable instrument for taker the holes required to receive the chargE of dying. ' mite with which the rock was afterwards mattered. The dredge Samson, working two bidders, has for a con- siderable time past been employed dredging stiff day a post one at the approach to the new dock at Cockatoo Island, and at that portion of Gurdon had where pre-. operations are being made for extensive when Ings for the Imperial Navy While not be employed the dredge has been availed of to dredge from time to time over the blutid rocky bottom at the new wharf on the eastern side of the Circular Quay. Although not of large dimensions or grub power, the Samson, owing to the great length of ter ladders, is specially adapted for the work at which it has been engaged, when a depth of over 30 feet is required. Fitted with Napier's patent differential clutch, this area is, it is said, well suited for dredging uneven rocky bottom, a chief feature in the clutch being its adaptability to transmit just as much power as the dredging Boarran be considered equal to without any part breaking. flu winches for working the dredge are driven from their engine by powerful belting, tightened by a lever under the winckruan's control, while the lowering brakes for we ladders, being of the difTorontiu] to, enable they'd. man, by the application of his unger and then, to lower the heavy ladders Inch by inch to the work. On the contrary wharf, which has been leased to the Orient S Navigation Company, there has been erected a bargain 200 foot in length. 40 feet in width, uudhavingítü height of about '20 feet. The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. The whole of the new docks is to be surrounded by a wall, in front of which is to be erected a station for the inspection of shipping. The cost of the dockyard is estimated at $75,000, and the work has been undertaken by contractors under the supervision of a board. The work is scheduled for six months and the whole of it to be finished at the end of the year. The wharves and piers are to be finished and ready for use at an estimated cost of $400,000. The contractor has stated that he will do his utmost to have the work completed within three months.
The Government has provided for the improvement of the harbour at Liverpool, by a grant of $3,000,000, which it has approved, upon the recommendation of the Minister of State for the Colonies, Mr W. P. Davies, the works to be performed being the enlargement and deepening of the existing harbour at that port. It is not stated what portion of the grant will be devoted to the new dockyard at Liverpool. It is stated that the whole work is to be carried out in a year. The work will be in charge of the State Docks, and will be supervised by a sub-squadron of the Royal Artillery. The work will consist in constructing a new dock to accommodate the Liverpool Steam Railway Company, and the works of deepening the harbour and widening the pier will be under contract. The works will be conducted in the manner following. A line will be laid from the New Street Bridge to the Dockyard at the distance of 40 feet; and the dockyard at a height of 8 feet above the sea-level; to enable its water supply to be conducted by the Dock Company, from the Canal Street Reservoir; and the deepening of the harbour to the depth of 34 feet will be commenced upon the eastern side. The pier will be lengthened to 70 feet and constructed of stone and brick. The cost of the work will be $65,000.
The Government has provided for the extension of the main lines of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which is a proposed project of great importance to the country. The main line is to consist of a canal in one section, from the Lake of the Woods to the Lake Champlain at a distance of 4,500 miles, and in another section from the Lake Champlain to the river St. Lawrence at a distance of 7,400 miles. The length of the canal in both sections is to be the same, 2,200 miles; and the present canal is to be enlarged to carry an additional water quantity of 5,000,000 gallons per minute. The main line is to be made in two stages. In the first stage the works consist of constructing a canal to the depth of 26 feet, to carry the additional water, the canal will be 200 feet wide, and the cost of the works will be $800,000. The Canal Company will erect a dock and a pumping station at the location of the present dam at the mouth of the canal. The dam is to be constructed in such a way as to prevent the formation of an oozy mud at any spot along the canal bed, in consequence of any sudden rise in the water. The construction of this dam will be to cost $700,000. A second stage of the canal will then be opened by erecting the additional dam at the location of the present dam. In this second stage the works will consist of erecting a deepening of the river at the location of the present dam to a depth of 25 feet, to a width of 800 feet. The cost of the deepening and widening of the canal will be $850,000.
The Government has approved the erection of a railway station at the junction of the Ottawa and Quebec Railway at a site which is to be determined. It is stated that the cost of the station is to be $25,000. The works will consist in erecting a station, a platform, a guard station and some warehouses. The station will be of the same type as that at Quebec City, Canada, and is being erected by a contractor.

The girdle also has a small section which it seems the Government would be able to enlarge by the addition of some stone to it, while some work is being ordered to enable it to be operated for the construction of a more permanent shore. The prospect for the operation of the dredge, and the extent of the new wharf, is of a great significance to the work on the northern shore of Cockatoo. The wharf can, however, be kept in a condition which will insure that such a provision shall not be made for such a temporary site. The two main advantages of the new wharf have been that there is no greater area, and that the dredge can be turned into the new building and used for purposes other than the construction of a new dock or harbor, and thus, by its operation, the wharf should be a permanent site. On the other hand, the dredge is subject to much risk from the possibility of accidents in such a scheme, as is seen on the recent occasion of a vessel being torpedoed on the wharf, by a boat not only approaching but also proceeding to dock on a pier. When in a position of this nature there is no means of making a permanent anchorage in the new anchorage, the dredge may be used as an interim position for such emergencies; but when it is used only for temporary purposes it may be carried on. There are no such conditions, in other words, the dredge can be carried on only to the extent of a permanent anchorage. This is because it does not require the addition of some other material, and is of no use if it is the purpose of the dredge to be used for a temporary anchorage or a temporary building, or if it does not be needed for purposes of a permanent anchorage. The conditions under which the dredge may be carried, and how it is carried on, are also of no use if the dredge is used for the purposes of construction of an auxiliary ship, or if the work of the dredge and the boat have been interrupted. In the case of the ship which has been torpedoed there was also an accident at the pier, where an anchor was left in place while the boats were moving from the dock. But the hazard, when a ship is torpedoed, and as there were no means of preventing such a danger to the coast, is that the","segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

The correspondent referred to also thinks that the appointment of a harbour trait would lead to the more satisfactory carrying out of harbour improvements. We have caused inquiries to be made about the recommendations contained in to letter, and have learnt that it is considered that the machinery which has been employed was the most suitable for the purpose. The rock which had to be removed was irregular and patchy, and was not suitable for the vessel. It has been fixed in the place it now lies, and has been fixed as an abscondement for it to come into being. To give it a good ooR- ing to the inhabitants, this means that there should not be any further disturbance of this work, as this has been carried to an extent that could not be satisfactorily done. For some years, a lot of machinery is needed for the erection of this bridge, and an immense and heavy building has been installed on the west bank of the lake. In the meantime a great portion of the land occupied by the new construction has been taken up by the settlers, who are now the inhabitants of the west bank of the lake. The water under the lake is, of course, in a deep and deep, so it will not be possible to raise a sufficient supply of it to meet the needs of the building. Mr. F. B. M. will be pleased to learn that the construction of this bridge was the most successful in all the preceding years, and that it will make an immediate impression on the people of the west bank of the lake. He states, as he said, that this work has been successful in all parts of the town of Syd Cove. He further adds that the work on the western bank of the lake is one of the finest of all the existing roads that have been built on the eastern side of the lake in recent years. The same is the case on the west bank of the lake. Mr. F. B. M. will note that the work was commenced by Mr. M., who is a naturalist, who has been in charge of the building of the dam and in the erection of the railway system. Mr. M. has been asked in this regard by the Government of Australia, and is very pleased to learn that the work of the dam has been successful in all parts of the town of Syd Cove. In the previous year Mr. B. M. took over as chairperson of the Water Department of the government in the town. There is, as he said, a strong sense of feeling that the great benefit is being received in the region, as the construction is going on on the west bank of the lake. In the end Mr. M. will advise the people that if the railway system is to be built in this region, a strong feeling is aroused among the people and the erection of this bridge will be a great victory.

Business people and others familiar with the cream of the steam dredge and other appliances used in connection with deepening operations on the eastern side of Circular Quay will, doubtless, be glad to learn that the work has been completed. The work has been in progress for about 2 years. It will be remembered that the building of three sections of new wharfs was finished about 11 or 12 months ago, two of the sections being about 600 feet in length, and the other (the central) being 640 feet. Opposite the wharf, it has been necessary to secure a depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides. For some time past attention has been devoted to that portion of the Sydney Cove which is bounded on the east by the central section of the wharf. It has been necessary to blast and dredge the rock in some places to a depth of 10 feet. The work has not been continuous, having been carried on only as opportunity would allow, otherwise it would, doubtless, have been completed much sooner. Serious obstruction was caused during the wool season in consequence of ships being berthed in that part of the harbour. A correspondent, who writes under the signature of ""Liner Experienced,"" attributes the delay to the character of the machinery employed. He expresses it as his conviction that it is of an antiquated description and urges that if the Government had imported from Melbourne one of Ford's Compressed Air Rock borers, and other appliances of a modern character, the work would have been expedited, and a considerable saving effected. The correspondent referred to also thinks that the appointment of a harbour trustee would lead to the more satisfactory carrying out of harbour improvements. We have caused inquiries to be made about the recommendations contained in the letter, and have learnt that it is considered that the machinery which has been employed was the most suitable for the purpose.

Although not of large dimensions or great power, the Samson, owing to the great length of her ladders, is specially adapted for the work at which it has been engaged, where a depth of over 30 feet is required. Fitted with Napier's patent differential clutch, this sprocket is, it is said, well suited for dredging uneven rocky bottoms, a chief feature in the clutch being its adaptability to transmit just as much power as the dredging bucket can be considered equal to without any part breaking. The winches for working the dredge are driven from their engine by powerful belting, tightened by a lever under the winch man's control, while the lowering brakes for the ladders, being of the differential type, enable the winch man, by the application of his finger and thumb, to lower the heavy ladders inch by inch to the work.

CORRECTED TEXT:","The writer is a member of the New Zealand Ship-Company, which is in charge of the maintenance of the wharf. The writer and his assistant are in charge of a dredge which has been supplied by the ship's new dredge for the wharf. The dredge was constructed in 1904, and the dredge is in use for almost fifty years. At the present time, the new dredge is to be replaced by a ""modern"" dredge which the dredge is to be replaced by. The new dredge has three large dredging machines and a large steam driller. The dredge is in the works to improve the efficiency of the work on the wharf. If the new dredge is satisfactory, it will be fitted with a steam engine, so as to operate in a greater amount of water, and to have more power in the process of raising the dredged rock from the beach to the dredging machine, in order to be more economical in dredging for the same amount of water. The dredge will be supplied with water for a period of at least six months. The writer is looking forward to the arrival of the new dredge on the wharf, for which it is urgently needed, but not on the grounds that the new dredge is satisfactory. The author will communicate the full details of the works required to bring about the new dredge to the Company.
On the 19th, July, 1909, the Government of New Zealand has proposed a dredging system which consists of a small fleet of steam drills. The company was authorized to designate one of the steam drill fleet as the dredge, which is a small fleet, with a diameter of 50 feet. As a preliminary to the work, the writer and his assistant have been invited to the site of the new wharf, and a preliminary survey has been performed. The plan for the dredging system is as follows: The first stage of work will be for raising the sand from the beach to the dredging machine. The dredge will have three dredging machines, each of which is equipped with two steam engines. The first steam engine, being in the centre of the dredging machine, will act as a spring, which will raise the sand in a direction in the direction of the current. The second steam engine, to be installed on the side of the dredging machine, will operate at a speed of approximately 50 feet per minute, or 20 feet per minute, to drive the drum in the direction in which the current is to flow. A third steam engine is to be installed on either side of the dredging machine. The third steam engine is in the centre of the dredging machine, as the dredging machine has a depth of 50 feet. The steam engine will work at a rate of about 40 feet per minute, or 10 feet per minute, to raise the sand up to the dredging machine in the direction of the current.
The dredging machine will have a diameter of 50 feet, and will be of the 100 feet type. The steam engine will have a diameter of 25 feet, to give a power of 25 cubic feet per minute, or 10 cubic feet per minute. In order to operate the steam engines, a hydraulic system must be built, and this will be carried out by a steam boiler. The steam driller is the only steam driller, since a battery battery will be","segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. The whole of the port of Sydney, although, it is said, to be being reha1ived, is now being occupied by a new station for the new steam driller, of which we have previously mentioned. We are of opinion that the removal of the clotting rock is now a comparatively eas; work is in progress on a part of the New Seas, by which part of the new dock is being constructed. The works of the New Seas are still at an early stage, the new dredges being fitted up. The works of the Messageries Maritimes will soon be in operation.
The ship is under the supervision of the Department of State for naval works. It is noteworthy that the New Seas, being located within a few miles of Sydney, has not been subjected to the same attention as Sydney, for the reasons that there is little communication between it and Sydney, and Sydney has made great efforts to construct a new dock.
THE REQUEST FOR DROPS
In this connection, I wish to mention the letter of a member of the Government concerning the position of the dredges in the Harbour, and in regard to the work they should have been in to make.
As a matter of fact, the dredges have not been worked since they were removed to Port Moresby. In this connection, I would request a reply from the Government.
It is said that the dock on the western side of the Circular Quay is a large one, and that work is to be carried on with great difficulty by steam drills. The water in that area is deep and turbulent, and that the work of the dock has been made under the circumstances. The work on the eastern side of the Circular Quay has not been accomplished, and the work of the New Seas on the eastern side of the harbour, will probably not be made till the first of December. The Government would be most anxious to have the dredges carried on, and to have it placed in operation.
I want a reply from the Government regarding the question as to what condition the work must be carried on. I am inclined to suppose that the work on the western side is now in progress, as the position of the dredges is not in a position to produce a work. The work on the eastern side is in progress, as is the position of the dredges. The dredge, as was said above, will be withdrawn from Port Moresby in December, and when the work on the eastern side is done, it will be brought in operation for a work which will be done soon. The Government will want a reply as to what condition the work must be carried on. They are, however, very much interested in the state of the work on the eastern side. A reply would seem to be desirable.
The Government wish to take a look at the work which has been done in connection with the removal of the clotting rock. It is said that the work has been carried on in order to remove the clotting rock, but the work is not finished, as in the last case the work would have required a much greater distance from Sydney to Port Moresby. The Government have no particular reasons to believe that the work is now in progress. Their information is, therefore, very insufficient.
THE GATE FOR FULL DROPS
The construction of the Gate for the full dredges in the Harbour is to be effected by the Government. They were originally designed to allow the operation of steam drills. The Government are now anxious to have the work carried on. A reply would seem to be desirable.
I should like to have the Government read of the proposal which the Government have put before the Government at this time for the extension of the port of Sydney to Port Stan. The Government have been assured by the Government, as I have already mentioned, that the port of Sydney is at an advanced stage in its construction, and that it will be done in about 10 or 15 years. The Government also do not believe that it would be of importance to have this extension done, as the port is only in a state of being completed to an extent so small that the work in question would be of no importance.
My Government have no intention of doing work in connection with the Port of Sydney until the extension has been completed, but they think that the Government may be well advised to make the extension as soon as possible. The Government would also wish to hear about the position of the Port of Sydney and its work in connection with the Harbour.
It is stated in the Government Circular No. 16 of 5 December, 1909, that the Government are now working closely with the Director of the Port of Sydney, to bring into full operation the Port of Sydney, and, in the same way, to bring it into complete operation.

CORRECTED TEXT:","A letter from ""Voyager"" published in to-day's (Friday) issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, criticises the department in the execution of repairs to the Circular Quay Wharf, Cockatoo Island, and tenders lmprovements. The writer says that the same want of judgment appears to have been displayed in the selection of machinery and plant for the carrying oi out the work, as a similar blunder wa ,1 toiue oy the Government over works in th e Blue Mountains. In regard to die machinery used in connex ion with the dredging at the Quay, be says, -No part of the heavy machinery has been broken by the work. The rock has been more or la-what loose and irregular, and the machinery consequently lighter than It would have been for taking out a compact solid mass. It is considered that the drh.e machinery when handled by competent workmen, ia perfectly effective for the work. It ha? been pointed out that, if the machinery of the latest deaBcription had been used, more speed would have been made. In replying to 'Voyager's' remarks respecting the appointment of a harbour engineer in charge of wharves and harbours, the Government Gazette says: -Before the present system was established, under the New South Wales Harbours and Rivers Improvement Act, there was a pier engineer, to whom the inspection of all materials, between wharves and basin walls, could have been safely entrusted. au employment oi such machinery elsewhere is unnecessary as workmen are available in Sydney and it cannot be said that in this case it would have saved money. Hut, the correspondent in question also thinks that the appointment of a harbour engineer would lead to the more satisfactory carrying out of harbour improvements. We have caused inquiries to be made about the recommendations contained in this letter, and have Htud that it is considered that the machinery which has been employed was the most suitable for the purpose. The rock that had to be removed was irregular and patchy, and consisted of a loft kind of sandstone. Had there been a large mass of compact rock to be operated upon steam drills could have been employed with advantage but it was thought that the ""juniper"" was the most suit able instrument for taking the hnifces required to receive the charge of dynamite with which the rock waa afterwards shattered. The dredge Samson, working two biaercs, has for a considerable time past been employed dredging stiff clay from a post one at the approach to the new dock at Cockatoo Island and at that portion of the wharf near the King-street entrance, where operations are being made for extensive wharves for the Imperial Navy. Although not now employed the dredge has been utilised from time to time to dredge from the rocky bottom at the new wharf on the eastern side of the Circular Quay. Although not of large dimensions or grub power, the Samson. owing to the great length of its iron ladders, is specially adapted for the work at which it has been engaged, when a depth of over 30 feet is required. Fitted with Napier's patent differential clutch, this appliance is, it is said, well suited for dredging uneven rocky bottom. A chief feature in the clutch being its adaptability to transmit just as much power as the dredging boat can be considered equal to without any part breaking.

THE SYDNEY WORKS.

The Commissioner of Public Works issued a notice on the 28th past that within twelve months from the l-tst day of November last, the plots upon which some contractors had erected ranges for the supply of light from the electric power house at the proposed works, would be thrown open for the purchase by any person desirous of leasing the same from the Government. The southern plots have already been let to defray the expense of erecting the necessary improvements for the supply of railway yards, General Post Office, and other offices, and it is intended that this kind of land should be reserved from other sales and left for such purposes. The northern plots which have been let to contractors in this and previous years, were reserved for this purpose ; the first portions only, however, have been secured. Ihe Government intend that all other plots in the vicinity shall be reserved as a determinated space or commonage for seeding, and they intend to let them under conditions on which the lessees will hold from year to year, subject to the usual conditions as to the duration of the lease and the amount of any advance in rent upon it each year. As they have an unlimited power to fix the rent from time to time, this advance may be considered as a kind of perpetual mortgage. It is presumed that for some years to come the Government will require the space between the site of the works and the foreshore for, at least, so much of the esplanade portion of the works as will be needed for the main office, tramway power house, machine shops, etc.. as well as for the residences in part of- the administrative staffs, and possibly some materials. Beyond that the Government intention is to reserve a strip of ground wide enough to give the necessary space for a road to the marine tramway to Sans Souci, or the Ocean Beach, or future tramway. This width to be about half the distance between the southwesterly end of the site of the works and the foreshore. The Municipality must also reserve their portion of the space marked out for broad road between the works and foreshore for the increase of traffic which it is supposed that the extension of railroads will give to this road.

High prices obtained at the sale of Mr Pickett's effects on Tuesday indicate the interest which a brisk trade exists in Australian works both here and abroad. Although situated in a somewhat unfrequented quarter, several single lots realised as much as £80 and £90 per mouth, and the following two pictures by same as that the facts are related by the Auctionee, in the history of the early settlement, have been sold for £530, realized by Mr Lyon for another great work. And it it will be remembered how recently the proceeds from the sale of the valuable effects of the lately deceased George Gullings had excited the min's attention to this period of history. A FEW PEOPLE WHO WI THEIR LIVES RE: The much talked of proclamation of the new Governor seems to be somewhat contradictory. If the accounts are to be relied on, Co.

CORRECTED TEXT:","The correspondent mentions that the machinery used for the work is of an antiquated description and suggests that the Government should have imported one of Ford's Compressed Air Rock borers and other modern appliances to expedite the work and save money. The correspondent also believes that the appointment of a harbor trait would lead to more satisfactory harbor improvements. We made inquiries regarding the recommendations in the letter and learned that the machinery used was considered the most suitable for the purpose. The rock that needed to be removed was irregular and patchy and consisted of a soft kind of sandstone. If there had been a large mass of dense rock, steam drills could have been used instead, but it was thought the ""juniper"" was the most suitable instrument for making the holes required to receive the charge of dynamite with which the rock was later blasted. 

The Samson dredge, working with two bidirectional pumps, has been dredging a thick layer of sediment for a considerable time past at the approach to the new dock at Cockatoo Island and at the portion of Gurdon where preparations are being made for extensive works for the Imperial Navy. While not being used for this work, the dredge has also been used to dredge from time to time over the rocky bottom at the new wharf on the eastern side of the Circular Quay. Although not of large dimensions or power, the Samson, owing to the great length of its ladders, is specially adapted for deep dredging work of over 30 feet. Fitted with Napier's patent differential clutch, this area is said to be well suited for dredging an uneven rocky bottom. A chief feature in the clutch is its adaptability to transmit just as much power as the dredging board can manage without any part breaking. The winches for working the dredge are driven by powerful belts tightened by a lever under the winchman's control. The lowering brakes for the ladders, being of the differential type, enables the operator, by the application of his fingers, to lower the heavy ladders inch by inch to the work. 

On the orient side of the wharf, which has been leased to the Orient Navigation Company, a shed 200 feet in length, 40 feet in width, and about 20 feet in height has been erected. The structure is currently open and is planned to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar specification will be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Philip Street side of the wharf, which is used for general shipping.","Work has been progressing on the Z wharf for some time, with the construction of three sections, two of which were around 600 feet in length, and the other was longer. The area opposite required blasting and dredging to create a depth of 20 feet at low tide. However, progress was slowed during the wool season due to delays caused by the type of machinery being used, which was described as antiquated. A correspondent writing under the name ""Liner oneed"" suggested that newer, modern equipment could have been used to save time and money. Inquiries have been made regarding these claims, and while it was determined that the machinery had been suitable for the work, it was also noted that steam drills would have been more effective had the rock been solid. The dredge Samson has been used to dredge stiff clay and rocky bottoms, and has been adapted to work in depths of over 30 feet using Napier's patent differential clutch. The newly-constructed Orient Navigation Company's wharf has been completed, while similar sheds are being erected on other wharfs. The Harbour and Rivers Department's next focus will be the construction of new wharfs and deepening of Darling Harbour, likely requiring steam drills. The aim is to excavate a uniform depth of 29 feet opposite the proposed wharfs.",GPT-3.5,prompt_complex_lang,prompt_complex_03_per_lang,zero-shot,results-overproof-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.6523775216138329,-0.290638464551508,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.20417441620169458,-0.7794150480017862,80-99%,-0.36903018319677705,Negative Improvement,218,847,Lower the heavy ladders inch by inch to the work.

CORRECTED TEXT:","and will give the most exact account of the situation of the port. There is a great deal of difficulty, not only in repairing the cracks in the sandstone, but in repairing the sandstone itself, and in fixing the siding, and it will be found it would be of more use to have a large boat at the Port than a small ship. I will, therefore, explain how a boat, of the size, and the general condition of the place, will be designed. It will have a two-man crew, one of which will be fitted with a large steamer, and a smaller one with a little steamer of the kind which has been employed at the Wharf since the establishment of the wharf. The steamer shall be of the large type, the others with a single steamer. When the steamer is in full sail, and on the beach, it will sail in two ways, each time having a boat of the kind to be used for the purpose of taking in and out of the place for loading and unloading of the goods.

1. A large boat having a crew of four men, with a steamer of the smaller type. The first of these vessels is designed as a three-seater boat, of a type in which one or two persons will sit on deck, while the other will lie on deck to the rear. The first person on board the steamer will lie on the side where the cargo of the vessel will lie. The second person will lie on the side to the rear, and the third person on the side to the rear of the vessel, which is the right side of the vessel. A small vessel will be fitted on the side opposite to the third person, and is designed with such features as will enable the first person on board the steamer to get his seat on the side opposite to the third person, while the third person on the right side will lie on the side to the rear. On the left side of the vessel, there will be a table with benches and chairs in front of it, and a platform on which will be placed a bedstead. The second person on board the steamer will lie on the side opposite to the third person, and on the side opposite to the third person, and on the side opposite to the third person, and on the side opposite to the third person, the table, platform, and bedstead will be a row of chairs.

The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. The whole of the work, with the exception of the dredging, been carried out under the supervision of Mr. Alfred W liauiB, Assistant Engineer. The work for the new wharf was begun by Mr. B. L, on the second quarter of September and had been carried out before a full and open period for the new work was obtained. A number of improvements to be made were made before the shire was permitted to commence work. One of these is to be found in the construction of the new wharf. The former was constructed at the expense of £5,000, and the new wharf to be erected at a cost of £7,000. The new wharf is to be built on a land that has previously been given to the Orient S Navigation Company. In this part of the harbour, at the head of the harbour liejt an existing, low, dolch-

the eastern side of the wharf, and is of a moderate size, a very low water level and a steep slope of almost four feet at its approach to the wharf, and is only accessible to the northward by a narrow channel which leads from the wharf to a gravel road. The present wharf, which has a height of about 4 feet, is to be constructed of a solid steel construction, and its width about 6 feet. The wharf is to be connected with the newly erected wharf of the Orient S Navigation Company, at the rear of the Wharf, which, having a width of about 6 feet, will be opened up to the westward. A large area of land to the west of the wharf will be given to the Orient S Navigation Company, and their new wharf being built on that land the number of passengers coming to the port will be increased and the number of berths increased. The work of this wharf, which will be completed in the autumn, will be made on the present wharf of the Orient S Navigation Company at the head of the harbour, the wharf being attached to a pier that will be opened for freight. The new wharf is to be constructed in a similar manner to the existing wharf, but of a larger length, the breadth being increased by one quarter. A new dock has been provided, with a height of about 6 feet, and the area of the wharf to be used to the west of this new wharf will be increased by one quarter, from the present length of the existing dock to the new wharf. This new dock will have a height of about 2 feet, and the length of the new wharf will be 6 feet. The wharf will have a width of about 2 feet, and the width of the new wharf will be 5 feet. The old wharf is to be closed up to the westward for the wharf and the pier, the length of which will be increased from the present length to the present length, from the present width to the new wharf.

The site for the new wharf at Cockatoo Island was formerly occupied by a number of Government wharfs, but these have now been abandoned. One of these wharfs was used as a residence by the Governor, and his family was quartered in it. His residence will be re-occupied by the Government, and a block of rooms will be assigned to the Commander-in-Chief of the Port. The site for a new wharf has already been selected at a spot some distance from the town.

For some time past attention has been devoted to that portion of the Syd Cove which is bounded on the east by the central seoUoocr the wharf. It has been accessory to blast and dredge to rock in some places to a depth of 10 foot. The work has not been continuous, having been carried on only as opportunity would allow, otherwise it would, doubtless have been completed much sooner. Serious induction was caused during the wool season in consequence of shire being berthed in that part of the harbour, a Mr spondent, who writes above the signature of ""Liner oneed,"" attributes - the delay to the character of the machinery employed.

The correspondent referred to also thinks that the appointment of a harbour trait would lead to the more satisfactory carrying out of harbour improvements. We have caused inquiries to be made about the recommendations contained in to letter, and have learnt that it is considered that the machinery which has been employed was the most suitable for the purpose. The rock which had to be removed was irregular and patchy, and consisted of a loft kind of sandstone.

Although not of large dimensions or grub power, the Samson, owing to the great length of ter ladders, is specially adapted for the work at which it has been engaged, when a depth of over 30 feet is required.

On the contrary wharf, which has been leased to the Orient S Navigation Company, there has been erected a bargain 200 foot in length. 40 feet in width, uudhavingítü height of about '20 feet. The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. The whole of the work, with the exception of the dredging, been carried out under the supervision of Mr. Alfred W liauiB, Assistant Engineer, Sydney Harbour Works, and Messrs. Geddis and Geddis, Masons. On the eastern side of the Circular Quay a considerable sum of money is at present being expended in the erection of a number of sheds and other buildings for the use of the steamships and packet boats which ply in the harbour. There is an intention on the part of the Government, in the near future, to commence the erection of a new wharf on the eastern side of the Circular Quay, and to extend the length of the wharf on the western side, in order to facilitate the entrance and egress of vessels. The erection of the buildings required for the new wharf will take considerable time, and will no doubt, be an important factor in the improvement of the shipping in Sydney Harbour. The construction of the wharf will be of a great extent, and the expense of the undertaking will be considerable. This will naturally lead to the conclusion that the Government, having made provision for a number of years, will not be in a position to commence the work in question, and that therefore it would be wise for the State to take out a loan on the most liberal terms, provided, of course, that the money be applied in a judicious manner, to the advantage of the State. The money required to do the work would of course be borrowed on a temporary basis, and the interest would form a small item in the annual expenses of the State. We trust, therefore, that a consideration will be given to the plan and terms of the loan by the Executive Council. We cannot fail to notice the letter of the Hon. George Grey, the Colonial Secretary, which we are printing in connection with the above. It is from the Minister for the Colonies in which he congratulates the Government upon the completion of the new wharf at Circular Quay, and he states that ""the people of Sydney can now see the fruit of their patience and their liberality, and the prospect of a period of unalloyed prosperity."" We feel assured that the letter is fully in accordance with the sentiments which have, so far as the interests of the State are concerned, guided the present Government in the discharge of its duties. The construction of the new wharf, we are satisfied, was an enterprise which ought to be welcomed by the inhabitants of Sydney, and the fact that it has been so is to be regarded as a happy omen of good things to come. We wish, however, to allude to the fact that there is a tendency among some of our residents to blame the Executive Council for not having proceeded with the work of the wharf sooner. We cannot agree with the idea that the Council could have done anything sooner, but we are quite in agreement in the opinion that it would have been wise in the Council to have commenced the work as soon as possible. We would, therefore, recommend to the Government that it should commence at once the erection of the buildings required for the new wharf, and to obtain a loan of a sufficient sum of money to complete the work. We think the course of proceeding to be adopted will be in harmony with the public feelings and also with the interests of the State.</s>",OPT-6.7B,prompt_complex_lang,prompt_complex_03_per_lang,zero-shot,results-overproof-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.2638112973308504,-0.7131452560162787,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.588283490372798,-0.3644331748350146,80-99%,-0.6522097855924064,Negative Improvement,1308,847,"The lower the heavy ladders inch by inch, the easier the work is to get to the bottom of the chimney.

The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. The whole of the dredging has been carried out by means of a Boanw, whose working mechanism is of the common type. It has an engine of 150 horsepower, and is able to work up to a depth of about 40 feet, in places where, owing to the bottom being hard, a depth of 70 feet may be easily attained. The Boanw is, it is said, quite suitable for the deep dredging in which it has been employed, and the quality of the work which it has performed is such that it would be difficult to get better for the price paid for it. It was a peculiarly favourable opportunity for the construction of the dredge, the vessel being used for the construction of the wharf, at a period when the harbour work was in a state of great development. The Boanw was purchased for $12,000, and was erected by the Messageries Maritimes in Melbourne in three months. In addition to the above work, the Boanw has been utilised on several occasions for the deep dredging of the harbour, having been employed on the works at the eastern and western extremities of the Circular Quay, and in places around the Cockatoo Island Dock. Its value to the Messageries Maritimes has been such that they have now employed the Boanw to perform dredging work on their wharf at Sydney. The Boanw is now being employed for the deep dredging of a portion of the harbour opposite the Phillip-street wharf. The Messageries Maritimes have employed the Boanw to carry out deep dredging work for a period of 18 months. It is to be noted that there is no necessity for the removal of dredged earth or rocks. The Boanw is the only machine which has been employed for the deep dredging of the harbour. It will be remembered that the Messageries Maritimes have had several boats employed for deep dredging, but these boats were of a very old type, and were found by their employers, to be so poor in point of construction as to have to be discarded after a short period. The Messageries Maritimes' Boanw is of a good class of vessel, and, in the opinion of many persons who have been concerned in its construction and the employment thereof, it is the best type of vessel that can be used for deep dredging. The Boanw will, doubtless, continue to be employed in deep dredging, while a new boat is being constructed to replace the old. The Boanw, in its present condition, is so complete that it can be used at any period as an agent in deep dredging, as well as for dredging operations in other places. The Boanw has been the only dredge which has been employed in deep dredging the harbour, and the Messageries Maritimes are now thinking of employing it on other occasions, while it is contemplated to construct a vessel which will be more suitable for deep dredging. The Boanw has been purchased for the Messageries Maritimes, who are the lierent for the harbour. It has been constructed and the cost of which has been borne by the Messageries Maritimes themselves, and is expected to cost in round figures £7,000. The Boanw was constructed by Messrs. Napier & Co., of Melbourne, who are well known for their extensive experience in construction of steam dredges. The boat is constructed of heavy iron, and is fitted with an engine of 150 horsepower, and a gearbox, complete with sprocket drive, and gear reduction gearing. This gearing makes it easy to work at any speed. The Boanw has a working capacity of 1,500 cubic yards per hour, and its working power is 600 horsepower. The boat will be fitted with a propeller of 150 horse-power, and a gearbox, complete with sprocket drive and gear reduction gearing.

At the present time the Samson is being used for the dredging of a large amount of blutid rock which is in readiness for the erection of the new Dock. On the new wharf the dredge will be employed to dredge, when the time shall be thought proper, the rock which is to be thrown out by the erection of the dock. The rock dredged by the Samson at this wharf will be sold to the quarries for the erection of stone walls, or the construction of dock and pier. The work is to be done in a month's time. The quarry and new wharf, which is to be erected upon the eastern side of the Circular Quay, is to be completed before the end of the year, and the dock is to be erected upon it after the end of the next year. The new wharf is to have a width of 300 feet. and a length of 300 feet. and will be covered with iron roofing, and the quarries, in the shape of a square, are to be of 50 feet by 50 feet, each side. The quarry in question is situated in a high position, overlooking the harbour and the quay. It is, of course, very exposed, but is surrounded with stone walls which will be raised in its rear. The work is to be done in six months, the work of erecting the new wharf being completed during the month of May. In the erection of the new wharf on the Phillip-street area, it is believed, that the Government has sufficient material for the erection of a dock in very good condition. It is not believed, however, that the material is sufficient for the erection of a pier or wharf, for it is, it is believed, in excess of that which could be readily employed. At the present time, however, it has been decided that a new pier or wharf shall be erected upon the western side of the Circular Quay. The work is to be done in six months, and the erection of the new pier or wharf during the same time. The erection of the new pier or wharf will involve the removal of a large amount of rock from the area adjoining to the wharf, which is known as the ""Blackburn Dock"" area. The work will, in fact, be in excess of what can be readily employed in erecting the new wharf. It is to be hoped that the new wharf will be completed before the end of the year.

This work has been commenced by Mr. A. R. O'Farrell, Inspector of Dredges, with the assistance of Mr. A. J. Riddell, Inspector of Works, under the superintendence of Mr. A. H. Wheatley, Assistant Engineer for Harbours and Rivers. It will take from one to two months to complete the dredging, after which the work on the boatyards will commence immediately. The dredge and boatyards will in addition be completed within three or four months. In all these operations it is expected that every possible economy will be carried out, that the work will be completed with the greatest accuracy, and that all the regulations regarding dredging shall be followed. We have been apprised of the fact that the Company have decided that the water will be drawn from the Syd Cove, and that the water-supply will be maintained by a tank at a depth of about 10 feet below sea-level. The water for use by the Company will be a mixture of water supplied from the main supply to the harbour, and that of the new pump at a depth of about 8 feet above the sea-level. The water-supply at the lower end of the new wharf will be of about the same quality as is the current. The pumping plant and the dredge for the new wharf will be connected at the sewerage works at Pierpoint, and the pipes for the dredge will also be connected to a pipe leading from the Syd Cove to the lower end of the wharf. The water supply from Pierpoint to the Syd Cove will be by means of a well in the same basin with the tank, and that for the Syd Cove by means of the tank itself, from which water will be pumped at a depth of about 8 feet. The pipes for carrying out the work in the dredge will be of steel, and they will be constructed so as to resist the action of the water on the tubes, and also to ensure good communication between the tank and the lower end of the wharf. The total area of dredging will be over 1000 square miles, and the work is projected to be completed before the end of this month.</s>",BLOOM-3B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-3b.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.26296829971181557,-0.7140618879749314,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.6700046217840087,-0.2761437006446042,80-99%,-0.5601409933079611,Negative Improvement,1170,847,"work, the distance is measured from the bottom of the lower ladder to the top of the work in",0.9473684210526315,0.29347826086956524,-0.6902173913043477,80-99%,13569000 year 1884 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 13569000,,,,,,limited

On the contrary wharf of Gurdon, in spite of its long line of berths, was fitted with a single well for dredging, being built by James Bay Company, on the southern edge of the Circular Quay. In the old years of the New Age the dredge of that date, being of the same nature as the Samson, had been employed as to work, the dredge being used as a ""plastic shovel"" for the work. The dredge and other implements were employed for the erection of an elaborate bridge upon the island from the south end of the wharf, in a work which took place in 1795. The original dredge, consisting of five tacks of three equal length, of a different size to that in which the iron canoes are used, and containing the most valuable tacking iron in the country, is carried in an iron car of this kind, at a cost of £40. Its use in the work is unknown. The rod being carried with the shaft, the end having an inclose attached to the end, the end of the rod being inserted on top of the rod. The shaft and rod being of this type, the tacks are of a similar length, the rod being of an unripe kind; a rod having the rod of a different material from that on the sump to which it is made; and the rod having a base on one end of the rod for the end of the shaft. One of the great advantages of such a work, as has been described, is its safety. To carry it for many hours at a time is very easy, and this would save the boat's crews a great number of time to carry off. On a similar occasion, a number of British vessels of the Admiralty were used, being hauled off on board in a dredge of about £6.5. A great number were hauled off at a great cost to their owners. The dredge and others used in this kind of work were, however, of different design. While the rod was carried on the boat, the rod was used on the dock to hold the rods in place and carry them down to the wharf, and to hold them for use. This type of dredge is not to be regarded as a particularly useful or useful service in the world at present, as a better way of securing water is available in the sea. A large number of such works are now being carried out for the use of the Admiralty. This work is to be carried on the island between","IMPROVEMENTS IN.

The dredge Samson, working two bidders, has shown himself, in a few hours, at his disposal, to be a suitable tool for the sinecure and conduction of the cava and sandstone. The stone and a large part of the clay which he has found to be the best in his own department has been prepared, and he has been able to get the mites in to the surface of the sea. His knowledge of the trade of England means that any changes in this kind of matter will have been felt and rectified in future. The work is being carried on by two companies, One of Mr. Spence, of Stirling, Northumberland, Southam and Pembrokeshire. We have also got word of a re- quest for the first of these, as a firm is set to take over the wharf in 1825. Mr. Spence will be the director of all the operations of the Company. It will be a business of great consequence, both for the sake of trade and for the convenience of our people and our capital. The following will be a few of the most remarkable aspects of the work. In 1823, the great manufacturer of cement and steel was chosen as co-oprst for an American firm. He was a man of prodigious talents and a good business man. In 1824, the great builder in a corner of the island named Thomas of Stirling was chosen and placed in charge of the construction. It will be remembered that it is he who first invented the milling machine, the building and the masonry. It is the most accurate and well-known of all the milling operations of America. The masonry of our nation has been built in America, but in the West there is no work of the kind which it can take. The milling machinery is made in England, and it is, therefore, the most accurate in the world. It is the only working masonry machine in America. No other milling machine in Europe can be more accurate and effective. In 1827, an American firm in Northumberland, called Kowall and Sons, was selected, on the recommendation of Dr. William R. Hill, to be their director of the construction. Kowall is a milling machine which Mr. Hill himself has worked with a large number of times, and it is very likely that this machine will be a very successful one.

On the,"On Saturday, 15th October, at 11 o'clock, the first boat race to be held over the distance of 6.7 miles between Woollahra and Bexley. will take place under the auspices of the Woollahra Rowing Club, the competing clubs being, viz., The Bexley (Potts Point), the Bondi, the Coogee, and the Randwick (Maroubra), with the Woollahra Rowing Club. A novel feature in the race is that a ""special prize of five pounds, will be awarded to the winning crew for their neatest time, and the committee are making arrangements with the Woollahra Rowing Club for the presentation of the prizes. In the early part of the season last year it was the intention of the committee to run the race, but a shortage of entries prevented it being carried out, and it is to be hoped that this season the interest manifested in rowing will be sufficient to induce the crews of all the clubs mentioned to compete. This event, although it only covers a distance of about six miles and a quarter, is a very fine one, and the time it will take to accomplish the course will be about an hour and a half.
The steamship Australia, which arrived in the harbour on Friday night last, was on her outward trip to Melbourne when the great disaster occurred at the time of the gale which swept the city, causing the death of 350 persons. The captain of the vessel, Mr. Charles Hume, was on board, and Mr. J. T. Stubbs, the well-known contractor, had gone on board on Friday morning. The ship had a good many passengers on board, but the loss of life was only one, an aged man named Thomas, who died on his arrival at Melbourne. It is reported that the captain had to use every effort possible to keep the ship afloat. When the Australia reached Melbourne on Thursday night, she was reported to have the wind ahead, with a fresh following sea, and she was a long time arriving at the wharf.
The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954), Sun 16 Oct 1864, Page 4</s>","It is not the intention to lower the whole of the depth of 26 feet at once, but by degrees, in order that the works may be executed expeditiously and satisfactorily. A considerable amount of rock has been excavated since last March, when the work was commenced, and it is expected that the whole of the rock can be removed during the current year. The work is likely to be carried on under the supervision of Mr. Portus, but for some time it was expected that Mr. B. A. Harvey, Engineer for Harbours, would be put in charge of the operations. This, however, has not been done. We are informed that, owing to his extensive experience in dealing with rocky beds, Mr. Harvey was considered to be peculiarly fitted to supervise the operations in Darling Harbour. The work at Darling Harbour will be prosecuted in connection with the new railway to Sydney and the new bridge over Darling Harbour.

The number of sheep on the land is nearly 1,000,000, and the cows about 20,000. The average number of the population living in cottages is 30,000. The total number of agricultural labourers is about 30,000. The average size of land is 50 acres, and the cost per annum of agricultural produce from the land under cultivation is over £750,000. The average rent per annum is £163,000, but it varies from 4s. 6d. to £120 per acre. The number of farmers living on their land is 20,000.
'THE GORONZO HILL SPECTACLES,
THE GORONZO HILL SPECTACLES, PERFORMANCE AT THE HAYMARKET. A few minutes' conversation in the lobby of the Haymarket, on the evening of Thursday last, convinced me that the spectacles at the ""Goronzo,"" as the new Haymarket Theatre is now called, were destined to be a great success. This is what I heard, ""The last time I saw a piece of acting like that it was on the stage of Covent Garden,"" said an elderly lady. ""It's as good as the best, it's as good as the best,"" said a man in the group. There was another. ""It's as good as the best."" There was still another, ""It's as good as the best."" Still another, ""It's as good as the best."" The general verdict was unanimous—it was as good as the best. And so it is, in every respect. Every one who has any pretensions to know anything about stage effects and stage management must have been struck with the very wonderful stage in the Haymarket Theatre. It is, I believe, the largest in London. It is nearly 60 feet wide, and its depth varies from 16 to 24 feet. It is so constructed that it may be raised or lowered with absolute ease, and its height may be increased, or decreased, at pleasure. The proscenium is 25 feet deep, and the height of the curtain from the footlights is 27 feet. It is an admirable theatre. It is said to be the finest in the world. The audience is arranged upon open-fronted benches, and, although there is room for about 3,000, the building appears to be very well filled. On Thursday evening there was a large number of ladies in the front seats, while the men, on the whole, were neatly and fashionably clad. Some of the gentlemen were rather eccentric in their dress, but this, probably, is attributable to their having been admitted from the pit to the front benches, as was the case with a large number who attended the performance of ""The White Sister."" I do not think the dress of the audience is of any consequence, however, in considering the merits of the spectacles. There are certain persons who will go to the Haymarket Theatre merely because they think it one of the show places of London, and, like the men I referred to, will say it is as good as the best. There are other persons, and they are the majority, who go to the Haymarket Theatre merely because the performances are good, and the price of admission is within the limit of their means. As I sat in my seat, and looked at the stage, I thought it could not be surpassed for beauty. I thought it might be surpassed in ingenuity, but I doubted if there was any way in which it could be improved. I had no sooner formed this opinion, however, than the curtain rose, and I was startled by the wonders which were revealed. The first performance was called ""The White Sister,"" and it was in many respects a wonderful production. I think the name of the actress who appeared as the heroine of this performance is Miss Lydia Thompson, and the name of the gentleman who played the leading part was Mr. Walter Satterthwaite. I confess I did not see the part played by Miss Thompson,",LLAMA-2-7B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-meta-llama-Llama-2-7b-hf.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.27521613832853026,-0.7007442224833529,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.2364124819177516,-0.7445858450546998,80-99%,-0.7223139297165915,Negative Improvement,833,847,"way, they will see that the scaffold has been taken down.

It has been necessary to blast and dredge the rock in some places to a depth of 10 feet. The work has not been continuous, having been carried on only as opportunity would allow, otherwise it would doubtless have been completed much sooner. Serious obstruction was caused during the wool season due to ships being berthed in that part of the harbour.

A correspondent, who writes under the signature of ""Liner Experienced,"" attributes the delay to the character of the machinery employed. He expresses his conviction that it is of an antiquated description and urges that if the Government had imported from Melbourne one of Ford's Compressed Air Rock Borers and other modern appliances, the work would have been expedited, and a considerable saving affected. The correspondent referred to also thinks that the appointment of a harbour trust would lead to more satisfactory carrying out of harbour improvements.

We have made inquiries about the recommendations contained in the letter and have learned that it is considered that the machinery which has been employed was the most suitable for the purpose. The rock that had to be removed was irregular and patchy, and consisted of a soft kind of sandstone. Had there been a large mass of solid rock to be operated upon, steam drills could have been employed with advantage; but it was thought that the ""juniper"" was the most suitable instrument for making the holes required to receive the charges of dynamite with which the rock was afterward shattered.

The Samson continued working at Circular Quay until the 12th May, 1878.
The Samson, 45 ft x 10 ft 6 in x 4 ft 3 in, was built in 1866 by the shipbuilders, J. & J. Elder, Glasgow. The Elder Brothers are credited with having built about 2000 vessels. Samson is one of 1104 similar dredges built for the Admiralty in 1867-8. A total of 3082 of the same design were built between 1867-1901. The following is an excerpt from a report of the Australian Royal Commission of 1881 on the construction of the breakwater for Portland Bay:
At the commencement of the contract the Government of Victoria placed at the disposal of the contractor, Mr. T. Ewing, a steamer called the ""Samson,"" and now belonging to the Government, which had been dredging in Sydney Harbour for the Imperial Government. This vessel, after being repaired and fitted, was towed from Sydney to the scene of operations, and put at the service of the Commissioner. This vessel and her appliances have been of great use.
At this stage of the history of the dredges, the ""Samson"" had been working for some time in Sydney Harbour, and had then been towed to Melbourne. The ""Samson"" continued dredging at Portland for some time, and then returned to Melbourne, where she remained until her final demise in 1916. The ""Samson"" was an unusual dredge in that she had no wheel-house. In fact, she had no upper deck at all.
""Melbourne Harbour Trustees' Dredge ""Samson""
Dredging the approaches to the New Customs Dock, Melbourne, by the Harbour Trustees' Dredge ""Samson.""
The Dredge Samson was towed from Sydney to Melbourne in August 1882 by the Government tug, Lady Augusta, 71ft x 13.5 ft, 168 ton.
The Samson remained a dredge of the Melbourne Harbour Trust until 1895. The Melbourne Harbour Trustees, who were the original owners, sold the dredge in 1895 to the Western Australian Dredging and Sluicing Company for use on the Perth Foreshore in a bid to dredge a channel and enable access to the river for commercial barges.

On the contrary wharf, which has been leased to the Orient S Navigation Company, there has been erected a bargain 200 foot in length. 40 feet in width, uudhavingítü height of about '20 feet. The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. The whole of the work, with the exception of the dredging, has been carried out by the firm of Woodhead and Brother, contractors, who were Hav. it in 1876 and 1877. The contractors are Messrs. W. E. Woodhead and Sons, of Sydney, and their work, although not free from defect, has been generally approved of. Some years ago, when it was proposed to commence the deepening of Sydney Cove, it was understood that the Sydney Harbour Trust would supply the necessary machinery, but, as the matter has turned out to be a very expensive one, they were obliged to apply to private enterprise for the requisite machinery, the Trust paying the amount of £33,000 to the proprietors of the Samson dredge. Mr. F. T. Palmer, the Government Harbour-master, reports that the new wharf and jetty, which has been completed at Woolwich, have now been turned over to the Trust, whose officials are busily engaged in con- ducting the work of deepening the harbour. As will be seen from the report of the Commissioners, the Trust have completed two of the sections of the new wharf, which are 400 feet long, and 45 feet broad. This is, I think, about the width of the wharf at Circular Quay, and the length is, of course, much greater, owing to the comparatively short length of the quay at Circular Quay. The Trust have not yet, as far as I know, taken any steps towards completing that portion of the wharf which has been recently completed at Woolwich. The question of deepening the harbour is not altogether as complete as it was two or three years ago. The Trust intend continuing their operations at Woolwich, as far as is now required. The dredging machines have been in use at Woolwich for some time, and although the work of the Trust has been suspended for the present, I do not think it is likely that the harbour will be as deep in some parts as it has been for the past two or three years. In fact, I am afraid that it may get worse. The reason of this is the very large quantity of debris that has been washed into the harbour from the sea, the result of heavy weather. I understand that a considerable quantity of shingle has recently been washed up, and there is also an accumulation of sand, which has come in from the westward. As it is, the bottom in some parts has been so deepened that a vessel has been stuck on the sand for several hours, and had to be lightened before she could proceed. At the same time it is, I think, quite possible that the harbour may be deepened still further in other parts, and that it may get deeper in some places where it has already been deepened.
The steam dredge Samson has for some time past been employed in deepening the approaches to the new Dock on Cockatoo Island tradicional a large quantity of gravel, and, in the course of the next few months, a large part of the area available for shipping will have been utilized. The Trust are, I understand, engaged on the work of deepening the approaches to Circular Quay, and they will probably continue the operations in this quarter for a considerable time to come. The dredge Samson has recently been engaged at the new wharf at Woolwich, which was commenced a little over three years ago, and has been completed, the Trust having erected a wharf 450 feet long and 45 feet wide. A dredge of 60 horse-power has been employed in the work, and at first, of course, the machine did not require to work so hard as it does at present. I believe that the Trust will be in a position to commence the deepening of the approaches to Circular Quay, on the north side, about the middle of this year, and, when they have finished this work, they will probably be able to take up the matter of deepening the approaches to the wharf at Garden Island, which will then be ready for that work.
The Sydney Harbour Trustees' report makes mention of the completion of the "" new wharf at Woolwich,"" as a work ""of great importance."" The report of the Commissioners, of course, speaks of the deepening of the harbour, and gives, as I said the other day, the length of the wharf as 350 feet, and the breadth as 50 feet, and also mentions the depth of water at low spring tides as about 19 feet.

On the,"These are of the size of large steam-ship batteries. ' The other section of the harbour, which comprises the dock and the harbour port, and the main road from the dock to the harbour and the port, was constructed in an old shipbuilding factory. The site, of size, is shown in fig. 4 . The harbour port was constructed in 1636, and was built as a port of trade to the British in the early years of the English Independence. The whole length of the harbour is 12,000 yards. The main road is 3 miles long and has a curve of 5 yards wide. It takes its toll from the entrance into the harbour by an angled staircase, and rises through a hole about 3 feet in diameter, the entrance through which leads to the interior of the harbour, a mile or so farther to the west, and then to the harbour, the port, and the main road.
The harbour has been described in more detail by R. A. Cook in ' A description of the harbour of Melbourne, ' &c. The harbour is formed by a series of large and low-street houses. This form has been retained, but the length of the street is increased by the extension of the harbour. The main entrance into the harbour was constructed from the centre of the village, and from the road which runs up the hill at the bottom of the harbour, by a side road. The road is divided in three halves. The first, which leads up the hill, carries through a series of buildings to the harbour, while the second passes through two of the harbour houses, and ends on the road. The third road, which is just opposite the harbour, runs on opposite sides from the road connecting them. The road leads into the harbour, and the main road leads to the harbour harbour port, which is built in the first quarter of the 17th century.
In 1767, after the restoration of the whole harbour, it was erected into a post, with the harbour itself divided into three sections. The first section is of a small size and consists of a series of brick houses, the principal being the ""old"" brick mansion, a building of considerable size which lies at the head of the harbour, in a position which is quite remarkable in that its roof and roof-tops have been painted red. The third section is of a larger size, consists of two smaller, but equally important, residences, both erected in 1682, with the interior of the mansion covered in a layer of red paint. The harbour is enclosed by a wall of brick, extending from the harbour to the port and to the main road. The road is divided in three halves, the first of which is dedicated to the Government, and leads to the harbour itself, and the other two halves are dedicated to the port and the harbour. The road continues up to the harbour and the main road, and there are four stone gates which cross the road from the entrance into the harbour to the port and the main road, and the gates are of the same type as the other gates at the harbour.

The whole of the work, with the exception of the dredging, been carried out under the supervision of Mr. Alfred W liauiB, Assistant Engineer for Harbours and Rivers, at the dredging has been executed under the direction of Mr. A. B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredges. The Orient Company took possession of their new wharf yesterday. The next work of importance to which the Hatbouta Company has been directed is to do the repair of some of the dilapidated buildings. This is the foundation of the new port. The harbour repair is a very expensive undertaking, and it will only be completed after the work of completion of the steam drills has been begun, or after the necessary improvements have been made to the wharf have been made, or after some other work. The repairs on the western side of the harbour will begin at the end of the year. The works for repair of the war- ders at the other end of the harbour are now almost complete, and the work of the harbour work has been commenced in a large part. In the meantime, the work of repair at the western side of the harbour is being carried on by Mr. A. C. M., Engineer of the Company, and will be completed in the following two years, with an addition of 20 feet of cementing being made to the side of the harbour at the commencement of the work in this area. The new harbour work has not been entirely carried on, because the company was at some periods compelled to give up the part of the work which had been completed in the new harbour. The other work which the Company wishes to do is to construct the new harbour on the eastern side of the harbour, in the immediate neighbourhood of the new dock. The construction of the new harbour will be carried out in a series of stages, each of which is a series of repair operations. In the first stage the work of repair will be completed. This will take place by means of two steam drills and the repair of some of the old buildings. The steam drills will be made on the west side of the harbour and the repair work on the eastern side of the harbour will consist of the following stage. This is a work of great importance to the Company. The repair of the harbour will not be completed until this work is finished. The Company is in a great financial position to carry on the works with the fullest confidence and confidence the Company in its undertakings, and that in making it so is its chief motive. This is for the present the highest confidence, and it is for this reason that the Company wishes to be the only company in the world to carry on this work with the fullest confidence.
Mr. C. J. G. has communicated to the Government the facts referred to in note 1 to the letter of the Director of the Post Office, who has informed the Ministers that the work for the repair of the old wharf on the western side of the harbour has been commenced. Mr. G. also says: 'The work will complete within the first six months. The work is to be commenced in the second quarter of this year, and the work will be complete at the end of the year. This work is very necessary for the rehabilitation of the harbour and the improvement of the harbour facilities. The work was begun by the Port Company, and the work is being carried on by the Company. The Company is in a position to undertake the works without any difficulties. The work for which the Company has been directed has been carried out in a great speed. It will not exceed a journey from the port at four o clock to the harbour in about four hours. The work is now in progress. The works have been made in accordance with the requirements of the Company, and the Company is in the possession of all the requisitions, from the building of the new harbour, the construction of the new port, and the repair of the old harbour. The company has been permitted to dispose of all the necessary building materials and building work without any trouble.
The Company is in possession of all the necessary capital, to carry out the works with the greatest profit, and will be in a position to make these works complete by the end of the year.' These facts will be communicated to the public during the month of December. He will be informed, however, that the company is at the moment preparing to apply for a capital grant to enable it to proceed with the works of repair of the harbour and to be able to do them in a great speed. The port of Sydney will be supplied with an engine for the new steam drills, and this will be accomplished by a new mill of a similar capacity to be found at a distance of ten miles from the harbour.</s>",BLOOM-560M,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.2540615278257864,-0.723746650511405,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.5143956172048024,-0.44425979199507953,80-99%,-0.5954934460296046,Negative Improvement,1566,847,"way down, the light ladders are always higher than the heavy ladders to prevent the",0.9473684210526315,0.3614457831325301,-0.6184738955823293,80-99%,13569000 year 1884 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 13569000,,,,,,limited

On the""","The correspondent suggests that the machinery used for the harbour improvements is outdated and recommends importing modern equipment like Ford's Compressed Air Rock borers from Melbourne to expedite the work and save money. Additionally, the writer thinks that appointing a harbour trait would ensure more satisfactory implementation of harbour improvements. We have enquired about these suggestions and found that the current machinery used is considered the most suitable for the project. The rock that needed to be removed was irregular and patchy and consisted of a soft kind of sandstone. Although steam drills could have been advantageous for larger masses, the ""juniper"" was deemed suitable for making the required holes for the dýn¸mite charge. The dredge Samson, which has a long ladder and Napier's patent differential clutch, has been dredging the stiff clay bed at the new dock at Cockatoo Island and Gurdon had, where preparations for the Imperial Navy are underway. It has also been used to dredge the rocky bottom at the new wharf on the eastern side of the Circular Quay periodically. The Samson may not be large but is well-suited for the work at hand. The winches are driven by powerful belting, with the lowering brakes being differentiable, so the work can be done inch-by-inch.","Improvements in Sydney's Eastern Quay""

Business people familiar with the ongoing deepening operations on the eastern side of Sydney's Circular Quay will be pleased to hear that the work has been completed. The project has taken around two years to finish, with the construction of three sections of new wharfs being completed 12 months ago. Two of the sections are around 600 feet in length, while the other is about 1,000 feet long. In order to berth larger ships, it was necessary to secure a depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides. The work on this section of Sydney Cove, which is bounded on the east by the central section of the wharf, involved blasting and dredging in some places to a depth of 10 feet. The work was carried out intermittently due to the availability of equipment, but it has now been completed.

During the wool season, delays were caused in that part of the harbour due to ships berthed in the area. A correspondent, writing under the name ""Liner Oneed,"" attributes the delay to the use of antiquated machinery. He suggests that if the Government had imported a Ford Compressed Air Rock Borer from Melbourne and other modern equipment, the work would have been expedited and savings made. The correspondent also advocates for the appointment of a harbour trait to oversee harbour improvements. However, after investigating the matter further, it has been found that the machinery used was considered the most suitable for the irregular and patchy sandstone rock that had to be removed. Large masses of coin rock could have been removed more efficiently with steam drills, but the ""juniper"" was the best device for creating the holes required to receive the chargE of dynamite with which the rock was afterwards broken up. The dredge Samson, working with two bidders, was used for the excavation.",GPT-3.5,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.3072766570605187,-0.6658832745789267,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.2496383550320314,-0.7302969412815361,80-99%,-0.4777390842991666,Negative Improvement,308,847,Lower the heavy ladders inch by inch to the work.

The second shed, a great store of tools and equipment, will be constructed on the western side of the wharf, and will bear the name of the wharf. The purpose of the new sheds will be to improve the working conditions of the dredging and to relieve the poor conditions of the old mooring shed, iu which it has been a constant source of complaint. A further purpose will be to improve the safety of the steamer wharf, the mooring shed, and the wharf on the east and west side of the Wharf. A new platform has been recently erected at the corner of the south side of the Wharf. The present stage of building will also be used for the building of a large steel work station, at the bottom of the wharf, at the same place, and on this purpose a huge steel work station is to be erected, with an entrance by the side of the new wharf, and to be completed In the next few weeks. We are satisfied that the old wharf shall remain with the Orient S Company as a public store. It will not be the subject of a public dispute. We have been advised that the steamer wharf at Cockatoo, which is a main vessel, has been sold at market. The old wharf remains with the Orient S Company as a store for the commercial purposes, and it will be maintained for the benefit of its inhabitants.

THE DINNER

A GORGEOUS DINNER

The last evening at The Mantle, with my wife and the whole party, was the last day of my engagement as a public servant, and the last of my service in the United States. The night before, at the office of the Mayor of the city, I made a special appearance at the door, to make my official announcement of my intention to return to the United States, after completing my service in the United States Navy. The evening was warmly received at the door. The people were in a great state of delight, and my presence was received with cheers and applause. After my return to America, my friends and I were all engaged in dinner. On the day preceding the dinner, I was told by one of the friends of my wife and of the family that I would be receiving a new dress at my residence in New York. This occasioned a great party in the house. The evening had been extremely comfortable. When dinner was over, the company of the party came back to the dining-room. The party was of a peculiar character, for I had never been invited to dinner, but was presented with a gift by one of the persons who had made the special request for my present. In a short time, however, they were all seated around the table, and the reception was renewed, during which time the party, who had been so pleased with the party in New","IMPROVEMENTS IN.

B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredges. The Orient Company took possession of their new wharf yesterday. The next work of importance to which the Hatboutaacl Rivers Department will devote its attention will be the con- struction of wharfs and deepening of Darling Harbour. At there is a large mass of mules, and other heavy articles, to be hauled by them to a depth of about a half a mile. This work will bring the wharf to a depth of about 200 feet. As this is an early work, the Government will be anxious to make the greatest advantage of this work, and will, doubtless, give an adequate compensation for the labor of the Department. The Department, with the aid of a substantial part of the Department, is to work on the dol.lge of the dau.p of the dau.p at Darling Harbour, a new place for the collection of the Dauphine River. The work is to be undertaken as soon as is practicable. On this occasion the Department will be assisted by Mr. B. L. K. W. Kline, who will be in charge of the working at Darling Harbour, and a small portion of the department which has been in charge of the digging-dun. The Department will, doubtless, be assisted by a large part of the Department, under the direction of Mr. W. H. S. H. of the Department of Mines and Geology, which is a considerable part of the Department in itself. Mr. W. J. W. Kline, Assistant Engineer, will be in charge of the dredging work. The Government, in order that the work will not be too late, have made several arrangements for the collection and treatment of the dauphine, and have received information from the City of Brisbane. The Dauphine was formed on the day that the new town was erected in Brisbane, and the dauphine, though now one of the most important waters in Australia, is considered to be of no interest to the government of Brisbane, and the Department has received reports concerning the state of affairs of the dauphine. The Department, with the assistance of a large part of the Department, are to work in the dauphine at Darling Harbour as soon as it is established. This is to be done in accordance with the recommendations of Mr. A. B. W liauiB, Inspector of Dredges, which is a considerable part of the Department in itself. We have been informed that the dredge Samson is to be employed. The Government are anxious to improve the conditions in which they operate. The Government have in- deucedly made some important changes in the Department, and have undertaken to make the most effectual improvement to which the Department will be able to respond. The Government will also be able to offer assistance to the Department in the matters they must contend with in order to make the best use of their limited resources. In order to assist the Department in this case they have made a request that they should provide for the relief of all who are not able to pay for their own water-services. These are not so great a burden as the water service in Brisbane. However, the Government have requested the Department to provide such relief as is necessary to keep them in the greatest possible possession of their resources. The Government, with the assistance of a substantial part of the Department, are to work in the dauphine of the dauphine at Darling Harbour, and to work at the entrance to the dauphine at Adelaide in the dauphine, the dauphine at which the department is to operate, the dauphine at which the Department are to operate. We have been informed that a large portion of the Department will be engaged on this work. It has been ascertained that the work which we have in view is of a small scale, and that although the men have been sent from Brisbane to Brisbane with their tools for a period of some months, they have never been engaged in the work. We should like to be able to say to them that they are now in excellent hands, and we wish to encourage them in their endeavours to make the best use of the resources they have to obtain such relief as is necessary. This will be done in accordance with the recommendation of Mr. A. B. W liauiB, Assistant Engineer for Harbours and Rivers. The Department is to work in the dauphine of the dauphine at Darling Harbour. The Department will provide a large supply of water-services to the people of Brisbane, and will work with the assistance of a large part of the Department to assist them in the operations of the Department. The Department are to work in the dauphine of the dauphine at Adelaide in the dauphine, and to work at the entrance to the dauphine at Adelaide, the dauphine at which the Department are to operate. In order to help the Department in this case we have asked them to send us a large supply of water-services to them.

The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. When completed there will be on the wharf a total of 3 sheds. The sheds on each side of the pier will be used for handling coal and timber. The sheds on the end of the dock will be used for stowing up and stowing away the stores and shipping. The shed to be erected on the landward side of the docks is to be connected with the wharf in the usual manner. It is stated that the whole of this building will be of the same design as the others. It is understood that the cost of the sheds to be erected on the landward side of the pier will not exceed £100,000. We think that the sheds of a similar character to those mentioned will have the effect of making the wharf at Cockatoo Island, which is now only served with a breakwater, into a very convenient and commodious dock. It has already been pointed out that the wharf at Cockatoo Island has been for some time past supplied with a breakwater for the protection of shipping. The cost of erecting this breakwater is £30,000, and the total cost of the works on the wharf is estimated at £180,000. The dock at Cockatoo Island is to be extended at a cost of £50,000, and the wharf extended a further 100 feet at a cost of £60,000. At the present time the total length of the dock, and of the wharf in its immediate vicinity, will be nearly 900 feet. The wharf at Cockatoo Island is to be supplied with two sets of steam cranes, one of which will be employed on the quay side of the dock, the other on the landward side. The latter will be used for loading and unloading vessels with cargoes from the railway pier, and will probably be used for the same purposes during the night. The cost of the new cranes will not exceed £10,000. The sheds on the landward side of the pier will have a roof to be supported by cantilever beams extending from the pier and resting on piles driven into the ground. The walls of the sheds will be made of wrought iron, and the roof of corrugated iron. The total cost of the sheds is estimated at £20,000, of which about £12,000 will be for the roof. The building on the wharf at Phillip-street will be of a similar character to those on the landward side of the pier, and the total cost of the building is estimated at £30,000. The sheds are to be covered with iron roofs, and will be fitted with the customary ladders for hoisting cargo from the railway pier. The buildings for stowing the stores will also be of a similar character to those mentioned, and are to be supported by pillars driven into the ground, and the whole building is to be covered with sheet iron. The total cost of the sheds is estimated at £20,000, of which about £15,000 is for the roof.","IMPROVEMENTS IN.

B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredges. The Orient Company took possession of their new wharf yesterday. The next work of importance to which the Hatboutaacl Rivers Department will devote its attention will be the con- struction of wharfs and deepening of Darling Harbour. At there is a large mass of rock to be blasted away on the eastern side of the Inner Harbour, but as the Government will not pay to dredge the bottom of the harbour, and it is considered that it will be impossible to raise the amount required by the dredge, and the cost of raising it by hand, it is thought that the next operation to which the attention of the department will be directed will be the con- tracting of a dredge. A great deal of money will probably be expended upon this work before it is finally completed, but it is not intended that the government will be the only party to the expense. The company will probably also pay a proportion of the cost of the dredge. The tender for the dredge, which has just been issued, will be opened on the 30th of January, and it is hoped that a contract will be awarded shortly afterwards. The object of the work will be to reduce the bottom of the Inner Harbour to the desired depth. This will enable vessels to enter and leave the harbour without having to change their course more than a few points. The dredge is to be of very large capacity, having the capacity of dredging over 30 feet. It is, it is said, the largest of its kind, and possesses all the latest improvements. We have been informed that some difficulty has been experienced in procuring a sufficent number of workmen. The dredge is to be supplied with the best available machinery, and the machinery must be of the most up-to-date character. We believe that the Government have been very ungrate- ful that so much time has elapsed since the work was ordered, as a considerable amount of money has been expended upon the machinery and the work has already been interrupted on several occasions, owing to the non-arrival of men, tools, and other requisites. We are, however, of opinion that the department have done as much as the situation of the work would justify, and have acted upon the advice of the competent engineers. We have been told that there is some doubt whether the dredge will be strong enough to resist the shocks which must be encountered in dredging such a hard bottom as that in the Inner Harbour. We will say no more about this matter, except that we hope a contract will soon be signed. In the meantime it will doubtless be necessary to contract for the labour of a number of workmen, and it is probable that the tenders will be open until the beginning of the summer. If the machinery be of a modern character, we suppose that the tenders will be open until quite late in the year. It is also probable that the machinery will not be able to be procured until early in the following spring, in order to have it ready for use in the opening of the new harbour, if no delay occurs in the building of the wharfs. It is thought that it will be necessary to raise the bottom of the Inner Harbour to about 40 feet. It is not likely that a contract will be signed for many months. There are also some suggestions to be made in connexion with a new wharf. The Harbour Master has been in favour of such a wharf, and the Governor-General has expressed his approbation of it. It is thought, however, that it will be difficult to obtain a large extent of land on which to build such a wharf, and it is proposed to lease a portion of the land at the southern end of Darling Harbour, which is nearly opposite the new wharf. The amount to be paid by the Government would be small, and if the land be leased to the Harbour Masters it will enable them to proceed with the building of the wharf without any interruption, while it will enable the department to act upon the plan which has been laid before them, which is the enlargement of the Circular Quay. The wharfs which are proposed to be built are to be 200 feet in length, 40 feet in width, and of sufficient height to admit of the shipping being docked in the same manner as at Circular Quay. It is believed that the Government will in the end have the wharfs built, but that they will not be ready for use for some time to come. We understand that the Government will shortly give the necessary permission to the Port Phillip and Melbourne Steamship Company to construct a new wharf in the vicinity of the Victoria Docks. The area for the building of the wharf will be in the nature of a small bay, situated immediately between the Victoria and New South Wales Docks. We hope that no unnecessary delay will be caused in the construction of the wharf, as it is believed that it will be of the utmost importance to the business of the Port to have a wharf in that neighbourhood. The Victoria Docks and wharf are already in great confusion, the traffic in the docks being so great, and the traffic in vessels between Port Phillip and the coast being so considerable, that there is a great want of room in the Victoria Docks for the",OPT-6.7B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.47093779015784587,-0.4879266331852017,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.4760983993984316,-0.4856351518890354,80-99%,-0.4761282466323973,Negative Improvement,1684,847,"other hand, lower the top heavy ladders inch by inch so they are in the same height and use",0.9473684210526315,0.5164835164835165,-0.45482295482295476,80-99%,13569000 year 1884 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 13569000,,,,,,limited

On the,"The Messageries Company has already placed its boats at the end of the line, and it is only a matter of time before the line is completed, when it will be possible for the Messageries boats to get out and take the line in during bad weather. In addition to the Messageries boats, there will be a number of pleasure boats also in the works at a time when there are about 30 pleasure boats in the harbour. This will provide a place for mooring pleasure boats at the end of the line, and it is to be hoped that this will induce the owners of pleasure boats to buy them. The Messageries company has, therefore, constructed two blocks of houses at the back of the wharf, and it is proposed to erect a third block, which will form part of the house block. The Messageries Maritimes are now constructing a house at the end of the line, and another is to be erected, so that there will be a good house block at the end of the line, from the Messageries Maritimes wharf to the wharf of the Orient Line. This wharf of the Orient Line will have a great advantage over all other wharves in that it will be able to take a much larger number of vessels at a time than is now the case. The Messageries Maritimes are building also a house block on the western side of the line, between the wharf at which the boats of the Messageries Maritimes and the one at which the boats of the Orient Line are landed, and there will be four blocks of houses erected. The wharf will, it is hoped, be made up of a yard of 50 feet long by 10 feet wide, with a dock of 70 feet long by 40 feet wide. The width of the yard will be sufficient for the Messageries boats, and the dock will be large enough for the ships of the Orient Line. A gangway leading from the wharf of the Messageries Maritimes to the dock of the Orient Line, and a gangway from the dock to the yard at the wharf of the Orient Line, will be constructed. The wharf is to be constructed of a light and strong cast-iron structure. It is also intended to erect a block of offices at the end of the wharf of the Orient Line, and at the eastern end of the line a block of stores. It is also intended to erect a wharf at the southern extremity of the wharf of the Messageries Maritimes, which will be able to receive vessels of the largest type. The Messageries Maritimes are, therefore, constructing a dock of large dimensions at the southern extremity of the wharf of the Orient Line. This dock will also be capable of receiving vessels of the largest dimensions. The dock at the eastern extremity of the line is also large and strong, and there is a provision to allow of the extension of the line from the wharf of the Messageries Maritimes towards the north and west.

M. HENRI LENOIR. The present writer was the son of Mr. George Lenoir, of the United States, who, on his arrival in Australia in 1837, married his former teacher, Mrs. Annette Bonaventure, sister of Mr. John. Bonaventure, and one of the best informed of the inhabitants of the Cape Province of South Africa. Mr. George Lenoir had a long and successful career in the United States, and the first English-born gentleman who ever resided in the district of Port Phillip was his son. He was a man of great ability and accomplishments, and was elected to the United States Senate as a Republican, and, like Mr. Rutherford, served a long and important period in that capacity. His son was born at Perth, New South Wales, on the 5th of March, 1834. His father removed to Melbourne in 1840, and Mr. Lenoir entered the English Commercial School. At the age of sixteen years Mr. Lenoir visited Holland with his father, and there acquired a knowledge of the language. About the age of seventeen he went to London, to learn about commerce and navigation. Upon his return to Australia he was appointed clerk to Mr. Thomas A. Campbell, the American Consul-General at Melbourne. He also obtained a good position at Mr. Campbell's bank. His father died in 1857, and about this time Mr. Lenoir went to England, and he there received an education at the University of Cambridge, and afterwards studied at Trinity College, Dublin. Having finished his education Mr. Lenoir visited a large number of British ports, and had experience both in the commercial and naval departments. Mr. Lenoir returned to Australia in 1860, where he was engaged as secretary to the Government of the Western Province. In 1864 he was sent to the Cape Province to assist in organizing the public school system there, and from this time until the year 1875 he was engaged as clerk of the Government of the Cape Colony, and was also employed as a lecturer in the School of Civil Engineering. In the following year he was sent to England to examine some of the steam ships lying in dock at Portsmouth. He then returned to the Cape, where he obtained employment with Messrs. H. and J. F. Taylor, and there, under the auspices of the New South Wales Government, was appointed Superintendent of Schools. He had charge of twenty-six schools at the Cape, of which three were at the head-quarters. He also became a member of the Public Service Commission, with which he served until 1880. In 1881 Mr. Lenoir was elected President of the Board of Education of the Western Province, and in 1882 he was nominated for re-election as such. Upon his return to New South Wales he became secretary to the New South Wales Council of Education. In 1890 he was elected member of the New South Wales Council for the province of South Australia, but was not re-elected. During this period Mr. Lenoir was a member of the Executive Council of the Council for the Education of Aborigines. In 1897 Mr. Lenoir became superintendent of the New South Wales Public Service, and he held this position until 1901, when he was appointed member of the Board of Education, a position which he still holds. He was appointed a magistrate in New South Wales in 1898, and continued to be a member of the Board of Education until 1907. Mr. Lenoir was appointed director of public instruction in the state of Victoria in 1900, and in 1903 he was nominated for re-election as member of the Board of Education. In May, 1907, Mr. Lenoir was appointed director-general of the Public Service of Victoria, and he served in this position until he became Commissioner of Lands. He is now in charge of the Education Department. In 1906 Mr. Lenoir was appointed a member of the Council of Education of New South Wales, and in 1913 he was nominated for re-election as member. Mr. Lenoir has also been appointed an examiner of the Civil Service examinations, and has been an examiner of several other classes of examinations. He has been appointed as a commissioner of education to the South Australian Government, and, as before mentioned, he is still a member of the Board of Education. Mr. Lenoir was in Australia from September, 1894, until January, 1897, when he went to England for a medical examination. He subsequently became an examiner of the Medical College of Melbourne, and he was appointed to a post in the Civil Service",BLOOM-7.1B,prompt_basic_01,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-7b1.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.24351585014409222,-0.7352134743439092,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.4826191517271535,-0.47859029354594873,80-99%,-0.6332167762454729,Negative Improvement,1604,847,day of the accident he had just climbed in.

CORRECTED TEXT:
The writer, of the New York Herald, writes to say that the City Council of New York is considering legislation requiring that all water-works, dredges, ship-yards, wharves, and other places of general industry should be so designed as not to become a source of the discharge of sewage into the streets and streams. This would require new buildings, but could be accomplished by re-digging of streets and draining out the drainage ditches. The chief obstacle to this, he says, is the great number of dredging and washing works in the city; but, in the absence of a better law to which to confine them, the City Council has decided to proceed gradually with this measure by allowing all the dredging and washing works to remain unrestricted, while those which have been designed to meet the increased requirements of the day will have the same treatment as other business firms, who may at any time be willing to abandon their operations.

SIR,--We wish to express our appreciation of the interest taken by the Chicago Tribune with regard to the recent failure to repair the steam drills at the Liverpool dock. As it was the only one which operated on the Liverpool dock and all the other boilers were in operation, some serious loss of time was suffered in the handling of the dock work, the only remedy being the immediate replacement of the drill. It would be difficult to say how much the time lost, or the amount of loss of efficiency, would have been avoided had the damage occurred on the side of the boat and not on the side of the dock. We wish also to express our satisfaction at your favourable consideration of the Liverpool Dock Company's suggestion that the workmen be allowed to buy a small amount of food to relieve them from the hardship of going back to work after a long absence.

SIR,--I have had some difficulty in finding a reference to the operation of a machine which is similar in appearance to that mentioned in the article. We have not been able to find any information as to its use. I regret that no such machine has been described in a similar manner to the one mentioned, but I am informed that it has been in use since about 1900. I am not certain whether the machine was originally designed for cleaning sand from the bottom of the docks, or whether it was constructed for other purposes; but, whatever its original purpose may have been, I think it would have been desirable to give it more frequent use. For example, the machine can be readily applied to the cleaning of the dock bottom when the water has flowed off the docks, and the sand could be lifted by the water and thrown into the harbour where it could be collected for some purpose. If the water could be allowed to flow in through the opening of the machine, the sand could be scraped off the bottom. We wish to know whether you think it would be desirable to make use of this machine. We are inclined to think that this would be a very important operation and one which would greatly help to improve the conditions of dockers.

THE COMMERCIAL DRIFT.
By CHARLES S. STROKES, M.C.M., LL.D.
THE DRIFT FROM LIVERPOOL. In the last issue of the Commercial Drift (June 27, 1897) there is a discussion of the subject, headed ' THE PROBLEMS OF THE DRIFT.'

The work has been in progress about Z yours. It will be remembered that the building Z three sections of now wharfs was finished about in or 12 months ago, two of the 8eetl(m8 v.: about 600 feet in length, and the other (the conttah m feet. Opposite the wharf it has been necessary to soenrV. depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides. For some time past attention has been devoted to that portion of the Syd Cove which is bounded on the east by the central seoUoocr the wharf. It has been accessory to blast and dredge to rock in some places to a depth of 10 foot. The work has not been continuous, having been carried on only as opportunity would allow, otherwise it would, doubtless have been completed much sooner. Serious induction was caused during the wool season in consequence of shire being berthed in that part of the harbour, a Mr spondent, who writes above the signature of ""Liner oneed,"" attributes - the delay to the character of the machinery employed.

On the contrary wharf, which has been leased to the Orient S Navigation Company, there has been erected a bargain 200 foot in length. 40 feet in width, uudhavingítü height of about '20 feet. The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. The whole of the accommodation on the wharfs will be occupied by the new wharf company, who will be chartered to store and unload ships. The Company is not aware that this new company is a private one, and has not been duly advertised in the Sydney Times and Daily Advertiser.
There will be great improvement in the dredging business during the last months of the year, owing to the appointment of a contractor to provide all the necessary machinery for the operations in the new wharf. A new company will also be established in the year for dredging in the old wharf. The annual value of the wharf is now estimated at £7,000, and there will doubtless be a large increase in the amount of trade carried on, if the wharf company be properly organised.
The Dockyard has been well attended to during the past year, a number of works having been carried on. Some of the works are at the last stages of completion. The works for the new wharf are nearly finished, and a portion of the works in the old wharf has recently been completed, including the necessary drainage and water supply. Two large dry bulk docks have been constructed, and will shortly be completed. The new wharf will be connected with the old wharf by a large pier, to which the old wharf is connected by an extended bridge and staircase, which will be finished in November. A new main entrance to the new wharf is proposed, with staircase to the pier. The main wharf will be constructed entirely on concrete foundation. It will be connected with the old wharf by an extension of the old wharf bridge. The new wharf pier will be about 200 feet long and 80 feet high, with a main entrance for stevedores and for vessels with laden vessels. This wharf is of great importance. It is expected that the shipping line from Australia to New Zealand will be extended to Sydney in the year 1900. The docks will be connected with a seawall, and the shipping line will be extended about 50 miles from the point of connection with the old wharf. The whole of the works will cost about £5,000, and are to be completed in three years. The cost of the dredging will amount to £3,500, but the value of the wharf company will be considerable. The Company intends to offer to sell some of the property they have built on the wharfs to the Government at a lower value, but not to exceed the amount they will receive. It is expected that the old wharf will have a value of £5,000 to £6,000. The Company intends to build a second wharf, and to increase the number of berths in the new wharf from twenty to thirty. The cost of this new wharf will be about £2,500. The Company has also a small dry bulk docks and large yards in the vicinity of the old wharf.
A considerable amount of damage has been sustained during the past year from the failure of the wharf and waterworks at the Port of Sydney, owing to the failure of the water works and a part of the wharf at the commencement of the year. The damage is estimated to amount to about £10,000. The old wharf will be restored in a short time, and the damage sustained will be in a great measure healed.
It is anticipated that the number of wharves will increase from fifty to seventy in the next ten years, and that the value of the property will increase enormously.
It is a matter of great concern to the Dockyard Company to see that the water works at the Sydney Dockyard are in a state of thorough repair, for the damage sustained to the wharf and waterworks in the last three months amounts to some £10,000, and it is thought that the damage sustained during the past year amounts to about £20,000. The Dockyard is in a position to repair the water works at a cost of £7,000.
THE SHIP'S REFUELING STATION. The establishment of the ship's refueling station is a matter which is in the hands of the Company for a considerable time, and the present state of the affairs, it is thought, is undesirable. The reason for the failure to start the refueling station is the difficulty of raising the necessary capital. It is understood that the Company, at a meeting held on the 23rd July, last year, requested and was given the opportunity to present a plan of the construction of the plant to the Commissioner, in order that he may advise his Government as to the means of carrying out this scheme. However, the Commissioner has not yet received the Company's communication, and as the matter is now in the hands of the Commissioner it will not be possible to discuss the matter at this time.

Although not of large dimensions or grub power, the Samson, owing to the great length of ter ladders, is specially adapted for the work at which it has been engaged, when a depth of over 30 feet is required. Fitted with Napier's patent differential clutch, this area is, it is said, well suited for dredging uneven rocky bottom, a chief feature in the clutch being its adaptability to transmit just as much power as the dredging Boarran be considered equal to without any part breaking down at any point between the bottom and top, without the obstruction which would make it difficult for the dredger to dig at it. The girdle also has a small section which it seems the Government would be able to enlarge by the addition of some stone to it, while some work is being ordered to enable it to be operated for the construction of a more permanent shore. The prospect for the operation of the dredge, and the extent of the new wharf, is of a great significance to the work on the northern shore of Cockatoo. The wharf can, however, be kept in a condition which will insure that such a provision shall not be made for such a temporary site. The two main advantages of the new wharf have been that there is no greater area, and that the dredge can be turned into the new building and used for purposes other than the construction of a new dock or harbor, and thus, by its operation, the wharf should be a permanent site. On the other hand, the dredge is subject to much risk from the possibility of accidents in such a scheme, as is seen on the recent occasion of a vessel being torpedoed on the wharf, by a boat not only approaching but also proceeding to dock on a pier. When in a position of this nature there is no means of making a permanent anchorage in the new anchorage, the dredge may be used as an interim position for such emergencies; but when it is used only for temporary purposes it may be carried on. There are no such conditions, in other words, the dredge can be carried on only to the extent of a permanent anchorage. This is because it does not require the addition of some other material, and is of no use if it is the purpose of the dredge to be used for a temporary anchorage or a temporary building, or if it does not be needed for purposes of a permanent anchorage. The conditions under which the dredge may be carried, and how it is carried on, are also of no use if the dredge is used for the purposes of construction of an auxiliary ship, or if the work of the dredge and the boat have been interrupted. In the case of the ship which has been torpedoed there was also an accident at the pier, where an anchor was left in place while the boats were moving from the dock. But the hazard, when a ship is torpedoed, and as there were no means of preventing such a danger to the coast, is that the","segment. Do not write anything else than the corrected text.

Serious induction was caused during the wool season in consequence of shire being berthed in that part of the harbour, a Mr spondent, who writes above the signature of ""Liner oneed,"" attributes - the delay to the character of the machinery employed.

The correspondent referred to also thinks that the appointment of a harbour trait would lead to the more satisfactory carrying out of harbour improvements. We have caused inquiries to be made about the recommendations contained in to letter, and have learnt that it is considered that the machinery which has been employed was the most suitable for the purpose. The rock which had to be removed was irregular and patchy, and was not suitable for the vessel. It has been fixed in the place it now lies, and has been fixed as an abscondement for it to come into being. To give it a good ooR- ing to the inhabitants, this means that there should not be any further disturbance of this work, as this has been carried to an extent that could not be satisfactorily done. For some years, a lot of machinery is needed for the erection of this bridge, and an immense and heavy building has been installed on the west bank of the lake. In the meantime a great portion of the land occupied by the new construction has been taken up by the settlers, who are now the inhabitants of the west bank of the lake. The water under the lake is, of course, in a deep and deep, so it will not be possible to raise a sufficient supply of it to meet the needs of the building. Mr. F. B. M. will be pleased to learn that the construction of this bridge was the most successful in all the preceding years, and that it will make an immediate impression on the people of the west bank of the lake. He states, as he said, that this work has been successful in all parts of the town of Syd Cove. He further adds that the work on the western bank of the lake is one of the finest of all the existing roads that have been built on the eastern side of the lake in recent years. The same is the case on the west bank of the lake. Mr. F. B. M. will note that the work was commenced by Mr. M., who is a naturalist, who has been in charge of the building of the dam and in the erection of the railway system. Mr. M. has been asked in this regard by the Government of Australia, and is very pleased to learn that the work of the dam has been successful in all parts of the town of Syd Cove. In the previous year Mr. B. M. took over as chairperson of the Water Department of the government in the town. There is, as he said, a strong sense of feeling that the great benefit is being received in the region, as the construction is going on on the west bank of the lake. In the end Mr. M. will advise the people that if the railway system is to be built in this region, a strong feeling is aroused among the people and the erection of this bridge will be a great victory.

Business people and others familiar with the cream of the steam dredge and other appliances used in connection with deepening operations on the eastern side of Circular Quay will, doubtless, be glad to learn that the work has been completed. The work has been in progress for about 2 years. It will be remembered that the building of three sections of new wharfs was finished about 11 or 12 months ago, two of the sections being about 600 feet in length, and the other (the central) being 640 feet. Opposite the wharf, it has been necessary to secure a depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides.

IMPROVEMENTS IN. SYDNEY OdP{ Business people and others familiar with the cream.! the steam dredge and other appliances used in connect with deepening operations on the eastern side of CiS Quay will, doubtless, be glad to learn that the wÄ been completed. The work has been in progress about Z yours. It will be remembered that the building Z three sections of now wharfs was finished about in or 12 months ago, two of the 8eetl(m8 v.: about 600 feet in length, and the other (the conttah m feet. Opposite the wharf it has been necessary to soenrV. depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides. For some time past attention has been devoted to that portion of the Syd Cove which is bounded on the east by the central seoUoocr the wharf. It has been accessory to blast and dredge to rock in some places to a depth of 10 foot. The work has not been continuous, having been carried on only as opportunity would allow, otherwise it would, doubtless have been completed much sooner. Serious induction was caused during the wool season in consequence of shire being berthed in that part of the harbour, a Mr spondent, who writes above the signature of ""Liner oneed,"" attributes - the delay to the character of the machinery employed. He expresses it as his conviction that it is of an antiquated description and"" urges that if the Government had imported from Melbourne one of Ford's Compressed Air Rock. borers, and other appliances of a modern character the wwk would have been expedited, and a con-' siderable saving effected.

On the contrary wharf, which has been leased to the Orient S Navigation Company, there has been erected a bargain 200 foot in length. 40 feet in width, uudhaving been designed by Mr. C. T. Y. Smith, one of the Government Engineers, and executed by Mr. John Mcdonald, of Circular Quay. This wharf is a most excellent example of the adaptability of iron and steel to construction purposes. It is in the form of a frame with an arched deck, and is, we believe, the first of its kind in Australia. It consists of 276 bargain, each 20 feet in length, with a 4 feet gutter at the top, and is intended to be erected in a short time by the company with the aid of the machinery of the shipbuilding yard. The space between the main deck and the arched gutter has been filled with timber bats to secure a dry level basement floor for the purposes of cargo stowage. The whole of this wharf has been erected in a very short time, and when the arched floor is put in place, it will be as clean a wharf as it is possible to get, as it can be cleaned with a water jet and a power brush, without the use of men and horses. The depth of water at low water springs at this place is 23 feet, and it is intended to provide for the deepening of the approach to the wharf to that depth and to dredge a channel at high water down to 30 feet below high water springs. When the wharf has been completed to the extent above-mentioned, it will be a magnificent structure, and the depth of water in the harbour at that part will be considerably increased. The depth in the entrance will be about 33 feet at low water spring tides, and the channel between Garden Island and Garden Point will be sufficiently deep for the accommodation of all classes of vessels, from 36 feet deep. In the mean time, however, it is not necessary to delay any of the improvement works in order to provide for the increasing demands of trade, and the Government engineers, it is believed, are at work to provide for the future accommodation of the harbour without much inconvenience to the public. The Government are also engaged in a somewhat important improvement in the river above the bridge, by the erection of a new landing stage in front of the wharf of the Metropolitan Steamship Company at Balmain. This landing stage has already been commenced, and it will be a handsome and substantial erection. As we stated in a former issue of the Australian, the Government is also having erected a new wharf for the Colonial Steam Navigation Company, and a landing stage has been commenced in front of the wharf of that company, at Balmain. The wharf for the Colonial Company has been designed by Mr. C. T. Y. Smith, and is to be 250 feet in length, and 45 feet wide. This company have engaged a dredge to be used in working their new wharf, and it is expected that it will be completed within the next fortnight. The wharf for the Metropolitan Company is 150 feet in length, and 45 feet wide. The wharf for the Colonial Company has been designed by Mr. C. T. Y.

This company have engaged a dredge to be used in working their new wharf, and it is expected that it will be completed within the next fortnight. The wharf for the Colonial Company is a handsome and substantial erection, and in the mean time it has been found necessary to dredge a channel from Garden Island to the new wharf. It is expected that this will be completed to-day. The Government is also erecting a new landing stage, which it is expected will be completed next week. This stage has been designed by Mr. C. T. Y.

It has not been possible to remove a few of the rock from a particular spot on the circular quarter, and it would not have been easy to operate the dredge upon the rock. In one spot a few fragments of the sandstone have been taken up, and in the other a few pieces of the hard rock have been taken up in an irregular manner. We must have carefully weighed the rock to be removed, and to secure the same. The amount of grain produced by the iron drill of the Samson, in which the dredge has been employed, has been found to be one tenth of that produced by a dredge of a smaller capacity, when the iron drill is operated on a comparatively small depth. No small piece of rock has been removed, but the average of the particles thrown up from the iron drill, in order to prevent the dredge from moving too strongly, must be carefully taken out. It appears from our observations that the iron drill is now in its advanced stages of operation. It was intended to be used, as far as possible, to remove sandstone, but as soon as it was able to do it on large grains, it was sent to the Messageries Marine. There will have been no difficulty in getting on to it, and there are no impediments to the work which can be carried out without the help of this machine.</s>",""" segment.

It will be remembered that the building Z three sections of now wharfs was finished about in or 12 months ago, two of the 8eetl(m8 v.: about 600 feet in length, and the other (the conttah m feet. Opposite the wharf it has been necessary to soenrV. depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides. For some time past attention has been devoted to that portion of the Syd Cove which is bounded on the east by the central seoUoocr the wharf. It has been accessory to blast and dredge to rock in some places to a depth of 10 foot. The work has not been continuous, having been carried on only as opportunity would allow, otherwise it would, doubtless have been completed much sooner. Serious induction was caused during the wool season in consequence of shire being berthed in that part of the harbour, a Mr spondent, who writes above the signature of ""Liner oneed,"" attributes - the delay to the character of the machinery employed. He expresses it as his conviction that it is of an antiquated description and"" urges that if the Government had imported from Melbourne one of Ford's Compressed Air Rock. borers, and other appliances of a modern character the wwk would have been expedited, and a con-' siderable saving effected. The correspondent referred to also thinks that the appointment of a harbour trait would lead to the more satisfactory carrying out of harbour improvements. We have caused inquiries to be made about the recommendations contained in to letter, and have learnt that it is considered that the machinery which has been employed was the most suitable for the purpose. The rock which had to be removed was irregular and patchy, and consisted of a loft kind of sandstone. Had there been a large mass of coin rock to be operated upon, steam drills could have been employed with advantage; but it was thought that the ""juniper"" was the most suitable instrument for taker the holes required to receive the chargE of dying. ' mite with which the rock was afterwards mattered. The dredge Samson, working two bidders, has for a con- siderable time past been employed dredging stiff day a post one at the approach to the new dock at Cockatoo Island, and at that portion of Gurdon had where pre-. operations are being made for extensive when Ings for the Imperial Navy While not be employed the dredge has been availed of to dredge from time to time over the blutid rocky bottom at the new wharf on the eastern side of the Circular Quay. Although not of large dimensions or grub power, the Samson, owing to the great length of ter ladders, is specially adapted for the work at which it has been engaged, when a depth of over 30 feet is required. Fitted with Napier's patent differential clutch, this area is, it is said, well suited for dredging uneven rocky bottom, a chief feature in the clutch being its adaptability to transmit just as much power as the dredging Boarran be considered equal to without any part breaking. flu winches for working the dredge are driven from their engine by powerful belting, tightened by a lever under the winckruan's control, while the lowering brakes for we ladders, being of the difTorontiu] to, enable they'd. man, by the application of his unger and then, to lower the heavy ladders Inch by inch to the work. On the contrary wharf, which has been leased to the Orient S Navigation Company, there has been erected a bargain 200 foot in length. 40 feet in width, uudhavingítü height of about '20 feet. The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. The whole of the wharf will be run from a single point; the new dock will, in the meantime, become the terminus of the port, and there will be an extended area for the loading and unloading of cargo. The wharf, in the direction of the new dock, is at a depth of about 10 feet. From the docks there will have been reached the New York coast, where the Whalers will be engaged in sailing at full speed; and there will be a station for the shipyards. This area, on which the docks are situated, will be used to a large extent for the loading and unloading of the wk to and from New York. The construction of the harbour was to be effected at a distance of 20 miles from the new dock, a distance which will not have been unfit for its purpose. The works have been undertaken to reduce the breadth of the harbour, and are to be carried on under the direction of the new harbour manager. They are in a very important fashion, as it is thought, to have a major effect on the future of the harbour, and the development of the port.
A. The wharf is now being erected by the Syd Cove Co., Ltd., which makes the building of the new wharf by hand. A large number of other works are to be made within the wharf to give it the appearance of a large harbour. The wharf has been cleared to the point that it is capable of carrying 20,000 tons per annum. The work on the harbour has been carried on under the direction of the Syd Cove, with the assistance of an Engineer and a Sub-Committee, and, of course, the work is in an excellent condition. The construction of the new harbour was begun by a large contractor of the Government, Mr. George J. Wilson. The work on the new harbour will be begun in the period from September 12, 1912 to September 26, 1912. The work is in a very important fashion to give the harbour the appearance of a large harbour.

CORRECTED TEXT:","A letter from ""Voyager"" published in to-day's (Friday) issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, criticises the department in the execution of repairs to the Circular Quay Wharf, Cockatoo Island, and tenders lmprovements. The writer says that the same want of judgment appears to have been displayed in the selection of machinery and plant for the carrying oi out the work, as a similar blunder wa ,1 toiue oy the Government over works in th e Blue Mountains. In regard to die machinery used in connex ion with the dredging at the Quay, be says, -No part of the heavy machinery has been broken by the work. The rock has been more or la-what loose and irregular, and the machinery consequently lighter than It would have been for taking out a compact solid mass. It is considered that the drh.e machinery when handled by competent workmen, ia perfectly effective for the work. It ha? been pointed out that, if the machinery of the latest deaBcription had been used, more speed would have been made. In replying to 'Voyager's' remarks respecting the appointment of a harbour engineer in charge of wharves and harbours, the Government Gazette says: -Before the present system was established, under the New South Wales Harbours and Rivers Improvement Act, there was a pier engineer, to whom the inspection of all materials, between wharves and basin walls, could have been safely entrusted. au employment oi such machinery elsewhere is unnecessary as workmen are available in Sydney and it cannot be said that in this case it would have saved money. Hut, the correspondent in question also thinks that the appointment of a harbour engineer would lead to the more satisfactory carrying out of harbour improvements. We have caused inquiries to be made about the recommendations contained in this letter, and have Htud that it is considered that the machinery which has been employed was the most suitable for the purpose. The rock that had to be removed was irregular and patchy, and consisted of a loft kind of sandstone. Had there been a large mass of compact rock to be operated upon steam drills could have been employed with advantage but it was thought that the ""juniper"" was the most suit able instrument for taking the hnifces required to receive the charge of dynamite with which the rock waa afterwards shattered. The dredge Samson, working two biaercs, has for a considerable time past been employed dredging stiff clay from a post one at the approach to the new dock at Cockatoo Island and at that portion of the wharf near the King-street entrance, where operations are being made for extensive wharves for the Imperial Navy. Although not now employed the dredge has been utilised from time to time to dredge from the rocky bottom at the new wharf on the eastern side of the Circular Quay. Although not of large dimensions or grub power, the Samson. owing to the great length of its iron ladders, is specially adapted for the work at which it has been engaged, when a depth of over 30 feet is required. Fitted with Napier's patent differential clutch, this appliance is, it is said, well suited for dredging uneven rocky bottom. A chief feature in the clutch being its adaptability to transmit just as much power as the dredging boat can be considered equal to without any part breaking.

THE SYDNEY WORKS.

The Commissioner of Public Works issued a notice on the 28th past that within twelve months from the l-tst day of November last, the plots upon which some contractors had erected ranges for the supply of light from the electric power house at the proposed works, would be thrown open for the purchase by any person desirous of leasing the same from the Government. The southern plots have already been let to defray the expense of erecting the necessary improvements for the supply of railway yards, General Post Office, and other offices, and it is intended that this kind of land should be reserved from other sales and left for such purposes. The northern plots which have been let to contractors in this and previous years, were reserved for this purpose ; the first portions only, however, have been secured. Ihe Government intend that all other plots in the vicinity shall be reserved as a determinated space or commonage for seeding, and they intend to let them under conditions on which the lessees will hold from year to year, subject to the usual conditions as to the duration of the lease and the amount of any advance in rent upon it each year. As they have an unlimited power to fix the rent from time to time, this advance may be considered as a kind of perpetual mortgage. It is presumed that for some years to come the Government will require the space between the site of the works and the foreshore for, at least, so much of the esplanade portion of the works as will be needed for the main office, tramway power house, machine shops, etc.. as well as for the residences in part of- the administrative staffs, and possibly some materials. Beyond that the Government intention is to reserve a strip of ground wide enough to give the necessary space for a road to the marine tramway to Sans Souci, or the Ocean Beach, or future tramway. This width to be about half the distance between the southwesterly end of the site of the works and the foreshore. The Municipality must also reserve their portion of the space marked out for broad road between the works and foreshore for the increase of traffic which it is supposed that the extension of railroads will give to this road.

High prices obtained at the sale of Mr Pickett's effects on Tuesday indicate the interest which a brisk trade exists in Australian works both here and abroad. Although situated in a somewhat unfrequented quarter, several single lots realised as much as £80 and £90 per mouth, and the following two pictures by same as that the facts are related by the Auctionee, in the history of the early settlement, have been sold for £530, realized by Mr Lyon for another great work. And it it will be remembered how recently the proceeds from the sale of the valuable effects of the lately deceased George Gullings had excited the min's attention to this period of history.

If there had been a large mass of dense rock, steam drills could have been used instead, but it was thought the ""juniper"" was the most suitable instrument for making the holes required to receive the charge of dynamite with which the rock was later blasted. 

The Samson dredge, working with two bidirectional pumps, has been dredging a thick layer of sediment for a considerable time past at the approach to the new dock at Cockatoo Island and at the portion of Gurdon where preparations are being made for extensive works for the Imperial Navy. While not being used for this work, the dredge has also been used to dredge from time to time over the rocky bottom at the new wharf on the eastern side of the Circular Quay. Although not of large dimensions or power, the Samson, owing to the great length of its ladders, is specially adapted for deep dredging work of over 30 feet. Fitted with Napier's patent differential clutch, this area is said to be well suited for dredging an uneven rocky bottom. A chief feature in the clutch is its adaptability to transmit just as much power as the dredging board can manage without any part breaking. The winches for working the dredge are driven by powerful belts tightened by a lever under the winchman's control. The lowering brakes for the ladders, being of the differential type, enables the operator, by the application of his fingers, to lower the heavy ladders inch by inch to the work. 

On the orient side of the wharf, which has been leased to the Orient Navigation Company, a shed 200 feet in length, 40 feet in width, and about 20 feet in height has been erected. The structure is currently open and is planned to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar specification will be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Philip Street side of the wharf, which is used for general shipping.","Work has been progressing on the Z wharf for some time, with the construction of three sections, two of which were around 600 feet in length, and the other was longer. The area opposite required blasting and dredging to create a depth of 20 feet at low tide. However, progress was slowed during the wool season due to delays caused by the type of machinery being used, which was described as antiquated. A correspondent writing under the name ""Liner oneed"" suggested that newer, modern equipment could have been used to save time and money. Inquiries have been made regarding these claims, and while it was determined that the machinery had been suitable for the work, it was also noted that steam drills would have been more effective had the rock been solid. The dredge Samson has been used to dredge stiff clay and rocky bottoms, and has been adapted to work in depths of over 30 feet using Napier's patent differential clutch. The newly-constructed Orient Navigation Company's wharf has been completed, while similar sheds are being erected on other wharfs. The Harbour and Rivers Department's next focus will be the construction of new wharfs and deepening of Darling Harbour, likely requiring steam drills.

","Gentlemen,
It is now six in the evening, and the water is still in a very cold and dark mood. The sea is moving rapidly and, as usual, it is very difficult to find a body of water for the vessels to go over. To avoid being lost we are despatched by a steamer to Newcastle, on the east coast. When we get there, the whole coast of North America is being inspected, and it seems as though our boat will not be quite out of water for some time. On her arrival, we are told that her hull is covered with an oily layer, which has been gradually getting up through the surface of the water, and is quite dry. It is feared that she will not be able to clear the surface of the water by the time we get over the surface of the sea. The vessel being examined she will be discharged in a few hours. On the morning after the inspection, the crew was discharged for the night, and the next day was Sunday, January 23, 1852.

Sometime ago Mr. H. K. L. Sargeant, Esq., received a letter from the President of the United States stating that he had been instructed to send a telegram to Mr. H. L. Sargeant informing him of the results of the examination, in respect to the wreck of the wreck of the HMS Nettle, which was wrecked at Sydney on the 17th of March, 1853. Mr. Sargeant replied by telling the President that the ship had been well recovered, but he could not disclose the nature of the problems which the President was concerned in, and that in order that the work of the wreck should not be neglected further investigation of the circumstances was necessary, and that his order should be forwarded to the Congress in the name of the President of the United States. After Mr. Sargeant's return from the trip, the President had not received any communication from him, or even a word from him since his return from the voyage, and was very uncertain of the whereabouts of the ship. As the President was anxious to hear from Mr. Sargeant, he called upon Mr. K. L. Sargeant, Esq., who was on the Board of Directors of the Government. After some brief conversation, Mr. K. L. Sargeant assured Mr. Sargeant that the President would never wish for the disaster which had been witnessed to be brought into the public domain, and that he was not the person to make any such proposal. Mr. Sargeant was very pleased to hear of Mr. Sargeant's desire to hear from the President, and Mr. Sargeant was pleased to know that the President of the United States had received the letter from Mr. L. Sargeant, informing him of the results of the examination. When asked if there was any possibility of a meeting of the parties, Mr. Sargeant said that there was none, and that he expected that nothing would be done until the President had received the report from the inspectors. The President had received the letter from Mr. Sargeant, and he was very anxious to know what Mr. Sargeant had in his possession, and if nothing should happen, he hoped that he would soon find out.

Correspondence of the New South Wales Herald.

[Sidenote: The Australian Palliasses.]

In his ""Letters on Australia"" published in London in 1831 Mr. Hume has, with great justice, stated that ""the population of the colony is to-day a very heterogeneous mixture of all that is best, worst and most curious"" among the Europeans who have passed over from the old world to Australia. The colony is now so well peopled with immigrants that we can readily see where, after the death of the last of the original settlers, the first-born offspring of the original colonists will be able to trace their ancestry to the original immigrants. We have, therefore, been in a position to make some further inquiries on this point, and the following extracts from a letter written by a gentleman in the colony are submitted as a contribution to the history of the aboriginal population of Australia. The writer refers to the early settlers who in former years came over from Europe, and who he represents as having taken part in the conflicts with the natives. These were, he says, gentlemen, who had been bred to the law and had studied it under the most perfect masters. They were men of considerable means and standing, and their success in the conflicts with the natives led to a belief that the law must be right and the natives wrong in any case, and it was thus that ""savage"" customs were gradually abolished. Mr. B.H. tells us that the aboriginal population are divided into a number of clans, and that they have their own courts of justice, and ""solicitor-generals."" They are said to be of very tall and powerful build, and are noted for their great strength and endurance. Mr. H. says that, with the exception of the blacks, who are ""all of a black colour,"" they are of different languages, and have their own modes of speech. He also states that there are three or four different kinds of palliasses, each having its peculiar mode of wearing their hair. We have also learnt that a large proportion of the aborigines now living in the colony are men who are the descendants of the original immigrants. They speak various dialects of the aboriginal language, and are much like the inhabitants of Tasmania in their general appearance. They, like the blacks, have their own mode of clothing and also of cooking their food. These descendants of the first settlers have been adopted into the different tribes. Thus, some of the original settlers were adopted into the tribe of the Koorongs, while some others were adopted into the tribe of the Kooris, some into the tribe of the Kooris-dil, and so on. In the following extract, the writer of the letter gives an account of the appearance of the blacks who now inhabit the colony.'""The blacks who inhabit the colony of New South Wales are a very various set of persons, some of the tribes of whom resemble the natives of British Columbia and Tasmania; but there are many who are entirely black, and are of a more southern origin, and are as white as any Europeans I have seen. I do not mean that they have all been of such pure blood as the white Englishman, but their skins are so white as to be scarcely to be distinguished from one another, and their","IMPROVEMENTS IN.

The whole of this portion of the Quay is to be fitted up as a public wharf for merchandise, the whole of which will be in operation as soon as the other portions are finished. The wharf on the western side of the Circular Quay was, it has been said, at one time a very dangerous place to be in, owing to the great depths of water which were attained at certain times. This fact, and the consequent difficulty of getting out, caused a serious loss of life among the men who were engaged upon the wharf and the other portions of the work, as it was the custom to get on board a boat, which was then pulled in at a great speed, by a crew of men, in order to be got out quickly enough to be saved from drowning.
The public is asked to remain cool in this matter, as all the works are being carefully managed, and there is no reason to fear that any thing of a serious nature is going to take place. - - -

On the,"In addition to the work already done in dredging over the whole extent of the Dock, it is further necessary to extend the dredge in depth. The work of digging the ground was, of course, at the outset done in the direction of the existing docks and wharves; but it is now proposed to move the digging down the eastern side of the wharves towards the Circular Quay, where it will then have to cross under the railings of the railway bridge. On the eastern side of the new docks, also, the rock must be removed and all the materials laid out for the use of the building trades. As the ground is very low, and the rock lying upon it is only about 2 feet thick, the whole of the work must be done in the night. For this reason, the digging must be done from an elevated pontoon, the whole of which has been provided with iron railings, to prevent any accident. The pontoon has a draft of about 14 feet. Two dredges are to be used. The Samson is a two-bidders machine of the Napier type, and is capable of operating at a depth of over 30 feet. The other dredge is a four-bidder machine of the Thompson type, and is adapted to be worked from a depth of from 8 to 10 feet. On the eastern side of the new wharf and along the eastern bank of the quayside is the work to be done; and the cutting operations on the eastern side of the new wharf will be performed during the day. The works being, however, to be carried out in the night, the time and expense will be much less than if the digging had been done at an early hour of the morning. The digger's wage will be about 12d. per hour, and a special arrangement will be made for the accommodation of the crew, to include their food, lodging, and medical treatment. The digging work at this station was started before the commencement of the season, and is proceeding at a very rapid rate. As there is a considerable number of persons engaged in the digging operations at this station, it was decided that the contract for the contractors should be granted to a small company, the members of which had to show their ability to perform the work to the same standard as that shown by the larger companies engaged. The contract is to be for the year from the 1 January till the 31 December, the amount being a little more than £6,000, of which £5,000 will be paid annually by the Government.

B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredges. The Orient Company took possession of their new wharf yesterday. The next work of importance in harbour improvements is the rebuilding of the dock on the east side of the Circular Quay, to which a good deal of attention is now being paid. For some time past the work has been under a very slow and inadequate progress, but it is hoped that an improvement of the dock will be effected in the near future. Mr. John Smith has also been appointed as the master-mason of the new dock, which will have its erection completed in a few months. A part of the work was accomplished in April last, and in some respects was exceedingly satisfactory. This portion consisted of the erection of a number of temporary blocks, about 4 feet high and 5 feet wide, to enable the masons to build upon without the loss of space at the docks. The material of the blocks was a plank, with four grooves in each. The blocks had a projecting part in front, with a grove on each side. They were placed upon a plank in the ground and the masons built upon them. The construction was very neat, and had the advantages of saving time in erecting the blocks, and the plank of the floor being readily available, the masons were able to work on a better system than in the ordinary manner. The block which was constructed in the rear was the highest, and had the most projecting part. This was a block of a great length, and it was necessary to build four of them in succession before reaching the height which was desired. This block was also constructed on the ground, and the masons were not disturbed in erecting the blocks. The work in the rear block was carried out in stages, first building the blocks about 30 feet in front, then continuing them on the ground, the masons using their ordinary methods of erecting blocks. It was thought that a system of this kind would be more convenient than the erection of blocks from the ground. The masons were very pleased with the system they had adopted. Mr. T. L. L. S. J. F.
Dredging and blast work, &c. at Sydney; and is now engaged in the erection of temporary blocks. The material employed is a fine planed timber of about 20 years of age. These blocks are to be placed on the planks of the wharves, and the masons will have the assistance of their teams. The workmen are to be employed in the erection of the blocks, when the work will probably be complete by Christmas. In the construction of the block on the ground, the masons will work in one group, the material used being laid upon the planks in the ground, by means of the blocks. The blocks in the ground are to be placed in the direction of the wharves, and the masons will use their ordinary methods of erecting blocks. A new dock has been completed at Sydney; and on the 1st October last the master-mason was presented with a contract for erecting two blocks of masonry in the dock, for the amount of £150 each. The dredging and blast work is to be executed by Messrs. C. D. B. & S. Co., of Melbourne.

The dredge is, however, capable of very hard-working work, and by the efforts of its divers it is found that a considerable proportion of dredge- work is undertaken by the divers who work it up. Some men may work it up and others in a large depth. If a person works out a dredge, he should hold it, and try it out upon his own initiative; it may be found that this will give him time to do it, and perhaps he may be able to work it out on his own initiative, but it will not last. The great weight of a dredge being carried to the surface by the water, it is considered safe to keep it in the bottom till he has put the drop off it. Mr. A., who works at the Admiralty, has said that the dredge has been at large used by the Admiralty for the construction of large-scale buildings in the Admiralty. The dredge, however, is often used by the Admiralty when a large amount of land is in progress for repairs or the construction of new dockyards or new wharves or other temporary works. He says that in one of his visits to London, when he met with the Governor of the Admiralty, he noticed that many people had been using the dredge. He has reported to him that for some years the people were so often busy at the wharf and pier, and that some had resorted to the dredge at the pier, that he should order them to work it out in advance. We believe it is not unusual to see a diver who works the dredge after a long day's work to make the next day's work. In the current day dredge is generally used at the station by the divers and others in the wharf. It is often worked under a girdle, under a pail, under a barge, under a ladder or some other place, as well as under a ladder at the station. In this sense there is a connection between dredge and ship work. The dredge at the wharf is a general use for dredging ship work, and it is not a particularly great use for dredge, as it tends to be hard to put out, and is not suitable for the working of vessels. The use of dredge in ship work has been reported to have been, but is not always a very good practice in England. The Government has proposed some modifications which could be made to the wharf dredge, and have ordered the Admiralty","IMPROVEMENTS IN.

The dredge Samson, working two or three days a week in the year 1843, at CiS Quay, is said to have been well and truly built, the whole of which was made in the style of the work in Victoria. Mr. Poulin, who lives near this place, writes on the subject at length. When the water ran out and the water was carried out it was, for the time being, done on its first day as we have heretofore mentioned. It is in the year 1843, when the rheat has dropped in the cC^r of New Years, when the mains are running. The new construction is much like that of our previous one, and although the old was only 8 feet, a new construction, of about 18 feet, is also to be made. This is in the course of which a number of repairs to the wharf were made, in the form of dredges and other works being put in to secure to the new construction the same dimensions and dimensions of the old, a large number of improvements being made on both sides of the wharf to be of a greater or lesser character, and the new design and arrangement of the building and the whole of the harbour are at the same time, to the best of my knowledge, so much improved. With these improvements there is but one defect and this is of major importance: it is much larger than the previous construction and is being repaired more quickly than the present one. The current work of the new construction is to be as follows: to be made as follows: 1. The new construction will be made as follows: 1. The dredges in the old work are to be replaced, the sandstone was to be changed in the new, and the two or three or four mains of the new constructed wether these are being carried out are to be put in, and the same new construction will be made to replace the sandstone, and the sandstone as well as the rock as follows. 2. For the latter work the dredges will be made with the same type of sandstone used in the old work as they will be in the new. 3. The old work will have to be replaced, to be made with the same type of sandstone used in the previous work, and the new work of the new construction to be made of the same type as the old, which will be as follows. 4.

The report of the Commissioners appointed by the Government for the settlement of certain claims in respect of the Ebor race meeting has been submitted to the Treasurer, but has not yet been laid on the table of the Legislative Assembly. The Commissioners have made their report, but it will be for the Treasurer to determine the amount of the refunds or the issue of fresh cheques to the persons whose claims are accepted.
His Excellency the Governor will leave Sydney on Friday to visit Brisbane and other towns in Queensland. He will take his departure from the steamer Fremantle at 11 o'clock.
We have been advised that a gentleman connected with the Australian Poultry and Pigeon Association has imported from California two of the newest and most successful pigeons in the American market. The names of the two birds are respectively ""The Golden Boy"" and ""Golden Gem."" The Golden Boy is the most remarkable bird of his kind in existence, and is worth his enormous price of $250. As an egg producer and a show bird he is second to none. The Golden Gem is a large, beautifully shaped pigeon, and is a magnificent performer, besides being the finest and most brilliant bird of his kind that can be found. The ""Golden Boy"" and ""Golden Gem"" are expected to arrive in Sydney in a few days, and the Association will have the birds on exhibition from Wednesday next.
The steamer Tumut, with the Governor and his party on board, left Sydney at 5.15 o'clock to-day for a voyage up the coast. The steamer will call at Newcastle and Taree, and it is expected that she will reach Brisbane early next week.

The work has been in progress for about two years. It will be remembered that the building of three sections of new wharfs was finished about 11 or 12 months ago, two of the sections were about 600 feet in length, and the other (the central section) was about 300 feet. Opposite the wharf, it has been necessary to secure a depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides.

For some time past, attention has been devoted to that portion of the Sydney Cove which is bounded on the east by the central section of the wharf. It has been necessary to blast and dredge the rock in some places to a depth of 10 feet. The work has not been continuous, having been carried on only as opportunity would allow, otherwise it would, doubtless, have been completed much sooner. Serious interruption was caused during the wool season in consequence of ships being berthed in that part of the harbour.

A correspondent, who writes above the signature of ""Liner Concerned,"" attributes the delay to the character of the machinery employed. He expresses it as his conviction that it is of an antiquated description and urges that if the Government had imported from Melbourne one of Ford's Compressed Air Rock Drills and other appliances of a modern character, the work would have been expedited, and a considerable saving effected.

The work which is to be carried out, as the said work has been described, is to be performed to the same extent as at the Messageries, and the work would be of a much larger size. No plans of work are being drawn up for these latter works, except those of the Messageries Marine. to the existing wharf, but in order to make use of the new place there will be a very large number of ships' and naval works upon the premises, but no plans for work on either site are being taken. It was pointed out that a large amount of iron and coal would be necessary for making the ironwork. It would be of considerable advantage if the new place were to serve for other purposes than the ironwork, and that the ironwork on the Messageries Marine site would be to serve for the purposes of the current dock, since the ironwork on the Messageries Marine site is very much larger than the ironwork on the New Messageries Marine site. No plans were being drawn up for this other purpose, and would be of great importance. the ironwork at the Messageries Marine site. The ironwork in the Messageries Marine site was erected in order to produce a vessel and, hence, to be used as a ship' and 'navy' work, but the ironwork at the Messageries Marine site was to be used for other purposes, but it was not to be construed to be for that purpose. The ironwork at the Messageries Marine site will be used for other purposes only. This work was carried out in November, 1863, as the ironwork in the Messageries Marine site has been used for some time. The ironwork in the Messageries Marine site rented out at that time is now in a better state than was formerly, and has, therefore, been extended for much longer than the ironwork in the Messageries Marine site, and for the work now done on both sites is now being completed.
Few plans have been drawn up for this new work on the Messageries Marine site, but the ironwork on the Messageries Marine site is large and of a heavy character, and will serve to provide for the use of many vessels, of the whole breadth of the harbour, during the long winter months. As the new wharf, and the ironwork at the Messageries Marine site are of a much larger size than is usually considered, it would be much easier for the Government to carry the ironwork to the Messageries Marine site. The ironwork in the Messageries Marine site is a much larger work than would be expected in the case of the ironwork on the Messageries Marine site, and would be much easier for the Government to carry the ironwork there. As a practical matter it would be much easier for the Government to carry out this ironwork in the Messageries Marine site. With","IMPROVEMENTS IN.

B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredges. The Orient Company took possession of their new wharf yesterday. The next work of importance is the construction of a deck and docks. The first work has been begun. A deck of the kind proposed by S. S. B. was chosen by Mr. D. B. in conjunction with Mr. L. G. W. S., Architects, and the plan is for a total of five or six decks, the roof being composed of a large slab of concrete and the building walls made up of clay brick. The floors are supported Sansislly. The whole of the work, with the exception of the deck, has been carried out under the direction of Mr. W. A. P. of the Department of Works and Driving. The plans for the construction of a new deck are very valuable, in that, while the original plan does not make for large structures and the construction has not been begun, the plans for the adjacent work can be of considerable value. The work has been begun in two stages. Stage I will include the construction of the d fondo. The floors, and there is no reason to believe that there will be any damage to the foundation. The work on the first decks has been begun in the usual order, and has been carried out by the Royal Navy. The second stage will consist of the construction of a deck and deck deck of a similar character, having a number of bidders. This last part of the work is to take place within the year, and the first stage of the work will have to be concluded in July or August, for which the first bidding will be made in October. At the present stage the work has been carried out under the supervision of Mr. W. S. A. and Mr. J. G. G., Engineers. Mr. F. A. E., Inspector of Dredges, has been employed on this second stage. Stage II will consist of the construction of a new and a few modifications will be made to a deck already built. The new deck has a depth of 8 or 9 feet. It will contain a wide roof, which can be supported without difficulty by the two main bidders, and will thus allow the work of the first stage of work to be carried out in the meantime, and to commence in the first instance in September. The work on the deck has been carried out under the supervision of Mr. B. A. and Mr. B. E., Engineers, while the work on the second stage has been conducted by Mr. S. S. S., Inspector of Dredges, and Mr. J. G. G., Engineer. The works begun for stage II will be completed at the end of October. In the meantime the d.docks will be occupied by Mr. H. S. S., and Mr. L. J. W., as superintendents. The final work on stage II is to begin on the 4th or 5th of November. The work to be carried out, by which there will be to be erected a docks and a deck, will be carried out by two companies, one each of which will operate at a rate of six boats per day. This will allow them to be engaged in a period of time of no more than forty-five hours a day. The work on stage I will, however, be completed within the first six months of the period of time specified. The works on stage II will then be completed during October. Stage III will be carried out during the autumn and a mamá work will have to be completed in the first two months of the period, for which the first bidding will be made in October, and the second bidding will be made in November. The work in stage II will begin at the end of October. The work in stage III will be completed during December. The work in stage IV will be carried out during the winter and the completion of this part of the work will then require a little more time.

Business people and others familiar with the port, the steam dredge, and other appliances used in connection with deepening operations on the eastern side of Circular Quay will doubtless be glad to learn that the work has been completed. The project has been in progress for about two years. It will be remembered that the construction of three sections of new wharves was finished about 10-12 months ago, two of which are approximately 600 feet in length, and the other (the container section) is about 1000 feet long. Opposite the wharf, it has been necessary to secure a depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides. 

For some time past, attention has been devoted to that portion of Sydney Cove which is bounded on the east by the central section of the wharf. It has been necessary to blast and dredge rock in some places to a depth of 10 feet. The work has not been continuous, occurring only as opportunity would allow, otherwise, it would have been completed much sooner. 

Serious disruption was caused during the wool season as a ship was berthed in that part of the harbor. A correspondent who writes under the signature of ""Liner Need"" attributes the delay to the character of the machinery employed. He expresses his conviction that it is of an antiquated description and urges that if the Government had imported from Melbourne one of Ford's Compressed Air Rock Borers, and other modern appliances, the work would have been expedited, and considerable savings made. The correspondent also thinks that the appointment of a harbor trait would lead to the more satisfactory carrying out of harbor improvements.

The Government has no intention of carrying out the recommendations in this letter. It is not thought to be advisable to attempt to work under these circumstances. These improvements are intended to replace the obsolete coal-carriages which have been used for the freighting of shipping from the Admiralty. It is said that the Government will be prepared to offer the shipyard money for the construction of a new steam brushing mill, and the building of a new water-mill, but it is not thought that this will be done in a timely manner. The Government has a stock of twenty million pound in the treasury. We will find nothing but speculation when we ask the President to make a declaration for the relief of the public purse. In the event of an incipient crisis the Government will at any rate be able to act in a timely manner, and the time has come for its consideration. As is generally the case, the Government is not in a condition of confidence, and when one does not consider that the President has a sufficient stock of securities, he will be inclined to consider that it is not necessary to make any declaration of such urgency. As we know that the Government has a stock of ten million pounds in the treasury, it is no wonder that a declaration of emergency should be made; but this is not the case, and we are not prepared to make any declaration now. There are not too many persons who will take offence to a declaration of emergency. The President has been informed of the proposal, and has taken it into consideration, but he is not prepared to act, because the Government has a stock of ten million pounds in the treasury. When the Secretary of State has told the President that there is not a penny in the treasury, we will not make any declaration on this point. "" The Government is aware of the fact that the present difficulties exist at the present time, and that it would be an offence to declare an emergency before the time which he has recommended is set aside. The only point of this emergency is the establishment of a means of regulating the movement of merchandise, and it is therefore not probable that the Government will be obliged to make a declaration now, in view of the circumstances. We are not yet prepared to declare a declaration of emergency, though it is thought to be probable that we shall do so. It is not probable that there will be anything like a large stock of merchandise, and the Government will be obliged to make a declaration when the situation is favourable. It is probable that the President will make the declaration now, in view of the circumstances.""'It is true that the Government have a stock of ten million pounds in the treasury. The Secretary of State, at a press conference this morning, was informed that the Government had ten million pounds in the treasury. It is not probable that the Government will be obliged to make such a declaration, and the Secretary of State cannot, it is thought, be prepared to do so.

The next work of importance to which the Hatboutaacl Rivers Department will devote its attention will be the con- struction of wharfs and deepening of Darling Harbour. At present the dredging work of the two mains is carried on by the Murchison & W. F. Robinson Excavation Company, and the work at the Wharf is under the supervision of Mr. W. C. McGeough, Esq. In preparation for these preparations the Wharf will be examined by the following persons: the headman of the Murchison & W. F. Robinson Excavation Company, Mr. A. B. McGeough, Esq. Mr. A. B. McGeough, Esq., has been in communication with his employer for the past seven months, on several of his operations, and has been provided with the necessary machinery for the work. Mr. McGeough was employed at the Wharf by Mr. W. C. McGeough, who, owing to the extraordinary interest which he has had in the work, will now be responsible for the operation of the Wharf. This operation, at the Wharf is of vital importance, and is expected to carry on for some time to the end of the year. Mr. McGeough, in connection with the operation at the Wharf, is now in communication with Mr. W. C. McGeough, who will receive the information of the present operation. As far as I can discern, the Wharf will be widened from the present four mains, to four, two, one and one. I can give you only a brief description of the work at the Wharf, in reference to which I am informed the work is already being carried on. In all respect it is quite a complete undertaking, and will last till the end of this season. It consists of three parts, three mains and three works. The wharf is three storeys high andApple water, which will be supplied by an inlet in the upper part of the wharf, a large pond in the lower part, and a pond in the upper part. All work is carried on under the supervision of Mr. A. B. McGeough, Esq., Inspector of Dredges, who is a master operator in the wharf, which has been used for over a year. The Wharf is now finished. When it is completed the work will be of a very delicate nature, and must not be treated with too much caution. I have been informed that, as Mr. McGeough intends to put in a retaining wall between the works, the work will be conducted under the supervision of Mr. W. C. McGeough, Esq. I cannot give you further details, for I have only seen Mr. McGeough work with some difficulty. It is hoped that he will remain in communication with his employer for some time. Mr. McGeough, I am informed, has received the order from the Admiralty. It is hoped that he will be in contact with the Commissioner and the Minister of War as soon as possible. I can assure you that the work at the Wharf is of a very delicate nature, and will be carried on by Mr. McGeough until the end of the year. Mr. McGeough, as I believe we have the confidence of you, I will try to give you some information in regard to the work at the Wharf. Mr. McGeough is on leave from the Department of Dredges for the period of three months, but I am not sure that he will be able to make use of the office till the end of January. The work at the Wharf will be of a very delicate nature, and must not be treated with too much caution. Mr. McGeough is on leave from the Department of Dredges for the period of three months, but I am not sure that he will be able to make use of the office until the end of January. There is no doubt that it will be necessary to perform some work at the Wharf before the end of this month, and the work there will be taken up in the office of Mr. McGeough, at a very earliest date.

A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. For the purpose of accommodating the sheds, piles of concrete have been laid to the depth of 20 feet to the centre of the water, where the foundations of the sheds will be placed. The site selected for the new dock at Cockatoo Island is of the roughest character, and a large excavation will be required to prepare the site. As the site is so difficult to be made accessible, and the harbour so narrow, the Government have determined to make use of the dredge Samson, when a sufficient depth of water shall have been reached to enable it to work. The sheds at Gurdon wharf, which are to be constructed for the Messageries Maritimes, have also to be built at the same time as the sheds at Cockatoo. They will be of the same dimensions, and will also have to be constructed for the accommodation of the dredges. They will also have to be enclosed with doors, but will not, like the sheds at Cockatoo, require doors to be fastened. The sheds at Gurdon are to be erected in time for the arrival of the liner SS Australasia, which is expected at the wharf in the course of next week. The sheds for Messageries Maritimes have not yet been erected, but will be, we are informed, erected about the middle of next month. -, We understand that Messageries Maritimes are going to have a dredge of their own, but until she arrives it is doubtful if they will be able to avail of this power. The Sydney Harbour Commissioners, who are going to dredge a part of the Harbour as soon as it shall be possible, have also a dredge of their own. We have the information that Messageries Maritimes have had their own dredge working at Cronulla for the last three months, and that they intend to have the same working for the new wharf at Cockatoo Island. It is further understood that the Messageries Maritimes have also employed the Samson in dredging up the foreshore to a depth of 30 feet at the site of the new dock at Cockatoo Island. - The new dock at Cockatoo Island will, when complete, be situated in the east bay of Cockatoo Island, and will be about 400 feet long and 250 feet in width, when the sheds will be finished. The shed will be of wood, and will be of the kind used in the old Dock, and will be 50 feet high. It is supposed that the sheds will be finished in time for the arrival of the liner SS Australasia on the 23rd inst. - The wharf at Circular Quay is being built upon a new site. A portion of the wharf, near the eastern shore, is to be used for storage. The wharf has a capacity of 600 tons per day, which will be increased to 8,000 tons when the sheds are finished.

These, it is understood, will soon be completed, and there is no doubt that the wharfs on the eastern side will also be in readiness to handle ships next season. The wharf opposite Circular Quay has been erected with the object of making it available for the reception of the ships which sail from the city, for which purpose the wharf has been deepened from 20 to 30 feet. The work has, of course, not been attended to at the expense of the Government. It is understood that the wharf which has been erected opposite the Circular Quay Station, and which is used for the handling of the steam vessels, will shortly be deepened and strengthened.</s>",OPT-6.7B,prompt_basic_02,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,results-overproof-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.4684268833087149,-0.49065686327262337,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.8262195121951219,-0.10737302533775511,80-99%,-0.4349400040223896,Negative Improvement,924,847,"outside.

On the,"It is understood that when the harbour master's office is re-arranged the building at the top of the Messageries Maritimes wharf will be made use of for that purpose. These three sheds are designed to be used for general shipments of goods, as well as for the storage of coal, which may become a necessity at the future development of the Harbour. The present coal storage is too narrow to permit the convenient loading of the coal barges, which in consequence have to wait several hours before they can come into the station. In addition to the three large coal sheds, two small ones are to be erected at different points to hold a small quantity of coal, and also to prevent the coal barges from carrying the water to a dangerous height at a time when the tide is running. On the other hand, a large number of smaller sheds are to be constructed, and a long gund will be erected by the Messageries Maritimes company to carry out general shipments. The Messageries Maritimes company are building a large vessel to carry out their shipping arrangements.
One of the great objects for which work is being pushed forward is the construction of a wharf on the eastern side of the Quay, to be used by the Merchants of Melbourne. It is supposed that the cost of the wharf will be about £120,000, and that it will be capable of receiving vessels weighing 200 tons. The proposed wharf is to be 400 feet long, but at present it is uncertain whether it will be possible to construct the gund at the same time with the wharf, or whether they will be erected separately. The wharf is to be used for large trading vessels, and has been selected in preference to the one on the western side of the Quay, because of the great depth of water on the eastern side, as well as for the convenience of the Messageries Maritimes company. The land needed for the erection of this wharf was acquired by a bond issue of £500,000 by the Melbourne Merchants Company. The bond is secured by an irrevocable deed, which is held by Messrs. K. B. Hoddle & Son, and is to be sold at auction after the completion of the wharf. The auction will probably be held within the next few days. The bond has to be surrendered to the Government before the work on the wharf can be commenced.
The cost of the wharf is expected to be about £120,000. In this respect the bond differs from the loan on which some work has been carried out, inasmuch as the Government is only interested in one part of the wharf. This has to be used for general shipping, and the sale of the bond will enable the Melbourne Merchants Company to carry on other projects connected with the Harbour. The cost of the bond was at first thought to be £200,000, but was reduced by the Merchants Company to £125,000, the proceeds of which are to be applied to paying off the principal of the loan.

B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredges. The Orient Company took possession of their new wharf yesterday. The next work of importance, after the completion of the wharf, is that for the laying of a stone road along the beach, at a cost of about 10,000 pounds. The company are in correspondence with Mr. S. R. Ewans, architect, for a plan of the erection of this work. The building of the wharf and road will not be done until the spring of next year. The first part of the road is to run down to the wharf, and a small portion will serve to complete the road which was first commenced in 1858. The remainder will be used for the conveyance of goods and materials to the wharf. The Eastern Star Line, for their new wharf at Portman, have obtained a building of 200 feet in length, 30 feet wide and 10 feet high. This has been constructed on the sandy bottom. They have also erected a sluice with a water fall of 6 feet. They have also constructed a dock in which the boats will be hauled in. These works were commenced about a month ago, and are being carried out under the supervision of Mr. S. R. Ewans. The Western Australia and Northern Australia Railway have completed a stone road, 200 feet in length, from the wharf at Portman to the railway yard. The works have been carried out by Mr. S. R. Ewans. The construction of another stone road of 150 feet in length, and 30 feet wide, between the wharf and the dockyard at Portman is now being carried out by Mr. Ewans under the supervision of Mr. F. J. C. Beeston. The construction of a stone road from the wharf at Portman to the road yard at Cedar, on the western shore, and of another stone road, of 50 feet in length, from the wharf to the Port of Port Hedland, is to be executed by Mr. Ewans. The works at the Port of Cedar are at an advanced stage of progress. A stone road of 200 feet in length, 30 feet wide, and 10 feet high, will be constructed there by Mr. S. R. Ewans, who has recently been appointed superintendent of the works there. The stone road at Port Hedland will be about 200 feet in length, and 30 feet wide. It has been decided by the committee of the Port Hedland Cove Improvement Committee to construct a stone road from the wharf to the main street at Port Hedland, with stone benches on both sides of the road, to which an overhanging stone lantern will be placed at each end. The width of the road will be 30 feet. The works on the Port Hedland Cove improvement will be carried out under the supervision of Mr. S. R.

The corrected text is:","The work done by the dredge at the wharf, which has been in operation for a period of not longer than one month, has been exceedingly satisfactory. The rocky bed was worked through and the work was executed by the aid of the dredge samson, which is well fitted for the purpose, and the work was speedy, and a saving was effected on the removal of the rock, which in fact had to be extracted. This was a difficult and dangerous work owing to the hardness of the rock. The work done, and the results obtained have been in accord with the price agreed upon with Mr. Tattersall in November last. The contract is for four months, the work will be completed early in March, and the whole of the work will be carried out at the cost of £200 per annum.
The present contract is for a term of five months, commencing in July next.
The writer hopes that in a few months more the work will be completed, and that the dredge will be put into use as a permanent establishment.
The Dredge. The dredge samson, by the aid of the two bidders which it is fitted with, is able to perform the task imposed on it. The apparatus is constructed according to the following specification :
Length: 200 feet.
Width: 40 feet.
Height: 20 feet.
Mass on the mast: 8,500 kg.
Mass on deck; 3,500 kg.
The weight of the load which can be carried on this machine is estimated at 4,000 kg. The machinery of the dredge consists of the engine, the machinery which moves the machinery and the dredging brakes.
The Engine.
The engine used is that fitted on the Samson, and of a very similar construction. It is arranged in the usual manner, with a crankcase to the right and the piston engine to the left. The cylinders are mounted transversely, and are provided with cylinders rods, and the camshaft is also mounted transversely, and is capable of moving the piston in either direction. In the crankcase is the water boiler, the pump, and the pressure gauge.
The Engine is capable of running on fuel oil, but it is not customary to burn it in this vessel; the only trouble that may arise is a deficiency of fuel.
The Engine has a capacity of 10,000 horse-power, and it is capable of running for five or six hours at full speed. The maximum rate at which the engine operates is at present about 80 revolutions minute. The engine is fitted with a pair of gear wheels and a pair of synchronised sprocket wheels.
The Piston Engine.
The piston engine is of the same general construction as that of the Samson, and is constructed of cast iron. It has four cylinders, the cylinder rods and the camshaft being mounted transversely. The camshaft is mounted transversely, and is capable of moving the piston in either direction. The cylinders are arranged at right angles to each other, the upper cylinder being in the shape of a conical cone, the lower one of a flat plate. The cylinders are arranged so that the pistons run the same distance in either direction, the difference","IMPROVEMENTS IN.

B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredging. For the operation of the dredges a special train of engines has been employed. For the purpose of obtaining a better view of the depth of the work and also for the purpose of carrying out the work upon the wharf, a steam tripod rig has been employed. The height of the rig from the deck is 80 feet. In consequence of the length of the wharf, it has been necessary to erect some small piles in the bed of the harbour to enable the crew of the dredges to work in the most convenient position for the operation of the dredges. The deepening of the harbour will greatly facilitate the discharge and admission of ships and it will also greatly shorten the voyage between Liverpool and Sydney. The deepening of the harbour will also enable shipping to be carried from Sydney to Brisbane, Melbourne, and New Zealand. The deepening of the harbour on the west side of the Circular Quay, and the deepening of the part of the harbour which forms the eastern boundary of the Port of Sydney, are both under the direction of the Engineer on the Eastern Suburbs and the deepening is being carried out by a contract company under the direction of Mr. E. J. Brown, a very skilful man. A contract has been taken to the construction of a new pier for vessels up to a length of 80 feet. The pier was originally intended to be constructed for the accommodation of the Imperial Navy vessel ""Mount Vernon."" The contract was awarded to Mr. C. R. Coombe. The new pier is not yet completed and the contractor intends to have the work completed before Christmas.</s>",BLOOM-3B,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-3b.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.24684192557186754,-0.7315968721553058,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.7359173126614987,-0.2049332717193587,80-99%,-0.5525680493558455,Negative Improvement,1034,847,"lower the heavy ladders inch by inch to the work.

The dredge has been used as it is in the construction of the new wharf, and in Thu'n's'The History of Man'at London and New York, 1780, p. 1; and in 'The Great War in England, p. 8. t The most useful of these was carried in the'A History of the New South Wales Island Railway, p. 11. A great number of ships, both British and U.S. ships, were used, for a number of years, in various parts of the South Island for dredging, and it is said that the New South Wales Coast Railway, one of the great and numerous vessels of the period, was used extensively by British convoys from the North to South Australia. When the New South Wales coast Railway was constructed in 1799, a number of companies from Australia and New Zealand, from the North to South Australia, were employed on the line, to repair the work. At the same time the New South Wales Coast Railway was in fact a company of the same name, and the company, which was to be called New South Wales Coast Railway, was to be called the Australian Coast Railway. The New South Wales Coast Railway is still a company of a similar name. In 1799, by the permission of the Admiralty, a number of British vessels were used for their repair. These were built to this day, and some were used as port-ships, some of which have been repaired by the service of the Admiralty. In the course of the next two years, as far as the following was known, the New South Wales Coast Railway was employed by six vessels in the service of the Great Western Railway from North to South Australia. In 1798, a number of vessels were used by British convoys from South Australia, one of which was used to ferry a group of convoys to Penrith from the South to North Australia, with a portion of the journey being carried on at Penrith. One of these ships was a company of the 'A History of the New South Wales Coast Railway' on an expedition of a number of British vessels from the North to South Australia, to repair and to supply port stores.

The rock which had to be removed was irregular and patchy, and consisted of a loft kind of sandstone. Had there been a large mass of coin rock to be operated upon, steam drills could have been employed with advantage; but it was thought that the ""juniper"" was the most suitable instrument for taker the holes required to receive the chargEry from the rock. In short, there was no need of such a machine. At first the plan was to construct a hasty trench in the werk which could be used for the passage of any steam engine. The idea was for one of these sections to be provided for, which was to be dug by means of a rope, or by the same method as the steam drill which had been used on the main section. After it was fixed, a large section of the werk would have been dug, which would enable the main section of the work to be opened up to meet the loading. After a short excavation, the werk would have been open again and connected with a railway line. The trench was also to be supported by the excavation shaft. The trench had to be very narrow in a very large part to permit the engine to pass through. The length of the work was to be 1.9 m. the length of the main werk, and to be 7.5 m. The work would have been to be done between two points in the main werk, and about 2 paces westward from the outlet in which the engine was connected to a tunnel. All this had to be completed, before work could commence. If a railway company were to be found who could arrange to transport them, the only alternative was to employ a local steam company. The plan had been outlined as follows. The main werk will be connected to a tunnel with a track through which a steam engine will pass. The tunnel should have been a stone or timber structure with the same shape as the main werk, but not in a straight line. The main werk should be laid out like this on one side of the ground as close to the outlet as possible, which would be 2.4 m. or 5.6 miles from the outlet, and the other side 1.6 m. on the other side of the ground. The main werk should be constructed to a height of 8 m. and 4.6 m., with the tracks 6.0 m. and 2.0 m. apart. This will be an extension of the old railway line which had been completed under an assumed form. The tunnel should be in a vertical form as isliberable in a steel frame. The main werk should be divided between two sections of a larger building on the other side of the ground, the main werk being constructed on the main line and the sections of a similar structure on the other side.

A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharves which were completed last year. It is expected that the work will be completed in about two months. When that time elapses the wharf will be in a condition to receive any of the mail steamers that may require accommodation for their passengers and mails. The Phillip Street Wharf is leased at a rent of 15 per annum to the Union Steam Ship Company, and the wharf recently completed will be utilized for the convenience of passengers and mails. The Phillip Street Wharf has been in a fair state of preservation for many years, and as it is conveniently situated and capable of being greatly extended, the Government decided to give a fresh lease of it to the Union Steam Ship Company for a period of ten years, the terms being similar to those at present payable to the other leases. By this arrangement, should the Government at any time decide to give further extensions, it will be able to do so without any undue disturbance of the present lessee. Mr F. R. Spaulding, the engineer, in charge of the work of deepening and widening the quay, has recently received from the Board of Trade of the United Kingdom an invitation to attend a meeting at Portsmouth, when a scheme will be laid before the Board, for the purpose of obtaining additional information in reference to the improvements made in the Circular Quay, Sydney, and which are to form the subject of a report by the Board to the Imperial Government. It will be remembered that the circular quay is being deepened and widened so as to enable the big ships that have been built in the British ship yards to make calls at Port Jackson. For some time past it has been the desire of the British Government to have Sydney made into a more important commercial port, and by means of these extensive and costly improvements it is hoped to convert the port into one of importance. The report of the Board to the Imperial Government will recommend such further improvements as the Government may think desirable.

After the usual morning service at the Domain, the Government party proceeded by steam launch to the Island, landing in the shipyard at about half-past eight. Here a procession was formed, consisting of members of the Legislative Council, and officers of the Customs, Harbour Trust, and Harbour Board, with a band, under the conductorship of Mr H. G. Ramsay. The Governor was met at the landing-place by the Commissioners of the Customs, Mr W. H. Hill, Mr W. J. Baxter, Mr J. T. Riley, and Mr E. T. O'Hara, who formed a guard of honour, which formed in the shipyard, and presented arms to the Governor. After inspecting the shipyard, the Governor inspected the wool-washing establishment, and viewed the machinery, and afterwards inspected the ship-repairing shops, and other works. The Governor, in making his speech at the opening, referred to the excellent work accomplished during the last two years by the various authorities connected with the harbour. In conclusion the Governor expressed the satisfaction of himself and of the Colony generally that the Island was used for the public service in such a manner as would bring a large revenue to the Government. He said that the harbour improvements were all proceeding satisfactorily, and he hoped they would be soon complete. He congratulated the Colony on being able to do so much in two years. The wharf was in the hands of a good tenant, who was at present making profitable use of it, and the result showed that the improvements at the harbour were all justified. The Governor was accompanied by his two daughters, Misses Gwynne.

The third line of the original letter refers to the fact that the
dredge Samson is fitted with a nipple valve, which allows for the
transplantation of the dead bodies from the dredging vessel to the
dredging bed. It appears that a valve of the same character had
been fitted in the dredging Boarran which operated in the new wharf on
the eastern side of the Circular Quay.

The second line of the original letter refers to the fact that ""with no
reasonable presumption of the accuracy of the description, and with no
recommendation in the same, we had taken in the goods which are
constituted of a material such as is used to make the work of an
engine, but we have made no further arrangements in this regard.""

The first line of the original letter refers to the fact that the
stainless steel was supplied by a manufacturer, which does not appear
to have the capacity to carry out operations in the dredging Boarran
as a whole. It is not to be supposed that the dredge Samson can safely
be used in such an environment; we shall be more exact when we make
mention of such operations elsewhere.

The second line of the original letter refers to the fact that
the dredge Samson's steam drum, being of the same principle as the
dredging Boarran, is suited for carrying out dredging operations on a
greater depth than any other vessel, having no capacity to operate
at higher depths, and cannot be employed at lower depths as
in the Boarran. The dredging Samson is therefore not a vessel suitable
for carrying out the work at which we were asked to carry out, and
should not be employed on such occasions.

In the case of the dredge Samson, which was fitted with a nipple
valve, and which is of the same character as the dredging Boarran
in which the steam drum is employed, we must not be relied on to
find a deficiency in the capacity of the vessel itself, and must not
believe that the dredge Samson could be employed on such an
opportunity as that. The dredge Samson, although not","IMPROVEMENTS IN.

The whole of the work, with the exception of the dredging, been carried out under the supervision of Mr. Alfred W liauiB, Assistant Engineer for Harbours and Rivers, at the dredging has been executed under the direction of Mr. A. B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredging, with the assistance of Mr. James T. Smith, Engineer for the Dredging and the Dredger in order to make the dredge more convenient, by giving rise to the design of new dredges and enlarging the existing dredged area. The work of seating the new dredge, or the work of constructing it, will be carried out by Mr. Robert J. Bower, Engineer. The existing seating the new dredge on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf will be done by Mr. Charles G. Lark. The working of the new dredge will be carried out by Mr. John D. R. Tait, Engineer. The existing dredge, which was built by Mr. A. G. Bower, will be built by Mr. George W. McNally, Engineer, who has superintended the works for the other dredge. The work of constructing the new dredge, is now being carried out under the supervision of Mr. F. P. Mowlton, Engineer. A new seating system is being constructed on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf. This system will have two new seats for each dredging and be built by Mr. J. F. Tait, Engineer. Mr. F. P. Mowlton will superintend the works in order to make them more useful, and Mr. James J. Smith, Engineer will make sure that the dredge is of a good quality. The whole of the work is carried on at a rate of three men, who will go to and fro on the sewing and dredging of the new dredge. This will be aided by an engineer, Mr. James W. Houghton, Assistant Engineer for the dredging, who will be responsible for the whole work. The seating of the new dredge will be completed within two months of commencement. The construction of the new dredge will be made by Mr. G. M. D. Walker, who will superintend the works.
Mr. A. B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredging, will, however, not be confined to the construction of the new dredge. Mr. James T. Smith, Engineer, will also, of course, be instrumental in the work of the dredge. The work of the dredge, as well as that of the new dredge, will be carried out by three men and their assistants. Mr. John E. W. Mclnlll, Engineer and Mr. James H. Roughley, Engineer will make a daily report to the Company of the dredging and its progress. Mr. F. P. Mowlton will superintend the works on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf. He will take charge of all the work of the dredging on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and will supervise the work of the new dredge on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, by which time the dredge, which had been built in 1859, will be fitted and ready to be used. The whole work is being carried on on a monthly basis, with the exception of the dredging which will continue running from time to time for the remaining forty years of the present dredging period.
This work will be performed by Mr. E. P. Mower, Engineer, with the assistance of Mr. W. F. McNally, Engineer. Mr. James J. Smith, Engineer, will be responsible for the works. A survey will be carried out by Mr. W. F. McNally, Engineer, of the area, with the assistance of Mr. F. P. Mowlton, Engineer, to verify the feasibility of the area for the work of dredging. The work of constructing the new dredge, and its complete completion, will be carried out by Mr. J. F. Tait, Engineer. The work of dredging and construction will be carried out by Mr. James P. Whiteside, Engineer, with the assistance of Mr. F. P. Mowlton, Engineer. Mr. J. P. Whiteside will be superintending the works.
Mr. E. P. Mower, will superintend the works on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf. He will be working on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf with Mr. H. F. F. Smith, Engineer, and Mr. J. M. F. D. Walker, Engineer, Mr. J. F. Tait, Engineer, and Mr. J. P. Whiteside, Engineer.

The corrected text is:","The steam dredge Samson has , since been employed dredging the port of Port Jackson. On the eastern side of the Circular Quay, at the south end of that locality, there has been erected a new wharf of concrete slab, 200 feet in length, 40 feet in width, and about 20 feet in height; it is open for about half its length to the park behind it, and •will be enclosed by doors. On the western side of the Quay, which has been leased to the Orient S. N. Co., there has been erected one of a similar description, with a shed next to it, being a large hall open at one side, but to be enclosed in future with doors. A similar shed on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and another upon the Phillip-street Wharf, which is used for general shipping, are also in course of erection. These works have extended the wharfage at the head of the Circular Quay by a distance of nearly one-quarter of a mile. On the Napier processes of dredging being applied by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Daniel McEacharn it was found that they were not well adapted for Sydney Harbor, being too expensive, and slow in operation. Accordingly, in September, 1882, when an appropriation of 50,000 was made for the continuation of the work of ensuring the granite blocks used in fhe pavement on the latter wharf, a further sum of £10,000 was also voted for the construction of West Wall, commencing at the Custom- house and conveniently approaching the higher bank rises above. The works were made by Messrs. Logan and Monro, contractors, and consist of a bulkhead with pier on each side, and of boulders placed outside it. The woris were completed in October, 1883. The intervening ground between the Wall and Dawes' Island (8 feet above high water) is a mud flat. and impassable at high tidewith anything but small boats ; it is a favorite resort of small boys and others, who are exposed to dan ger and are not supposed to bathe there. The occupation of this strip by boats loading with china clay at that part has led to such occa sional work as the A. S. N. Co. have at times done in the former case, local shipping; but in this, notwith standing the keen competition by a wealthy company, who, with their extensive coaling quays alongside, have been able to transport vessels free, as required, nnd with quicksilvery facilities for delivering cargoes, no attempt has yet been made towards improving the need for an expenditure greatly out of proportion to the importance at the present day of the so-called Butchers' Bay. Approached from the wharf by stairs, the steep bluff of Dawes' Island, where it was supposed the self-constituted Vigilant, in 1806, took refuge and showed defiance to the Governor's men of war, has, by the erection of a strong and substantial wall of huge boulders, below the lighthouse., capably withstood the battering, upon the cont","attention will be the deepening of alarge portion of Rouse's Bay, in Botany Bay.

The corrected text is:","The author of the letter argues that the machinery used for the recent construction work is out-of-date and suggests that importing modern equipment, such as Ford's Compressed Air Rock borers from Melbourne, would have expedited the work and saved costs. The author also proposes that the appointment of a harbor trait could lead to more satisfactory results in future harbor improvements. We have investigated the recommendations contained in the aforementioned letter and have discovered that experts believe the machinery used was the most suitable for the task. The rock that had to be removed was patchy and irregular and consisted of a soft type of sandstone. Although steam drills would have been more suitable if there was a large mass of hard rock to work on, it was thought that the ""juniper"" was the best tool for digging holes to place the charges of dynamite. The dredge Samson, with two ladders, has been employed extensively for a considerable period of time dredging stiff clay in the approach to the new dock at Cockatoo Island and in the area of Gurdon where preparations are being made for extensive works for the Imperial Navy. The Samson has also been used to dredge occasionally over the rocky bottom at the new wharf on the eastern side of the Circular Quay. Although the Samson is not particularly large in size or power, its lengthy ladders make it suitable for work, especially when a depth of over 30 feet is required. Fitted with Napier's patent differential clutch, which has the ability to transmit just the right amount of power for the job without breaking any parts, this dredge is ideal for dredging rocky bottom, which can be quite uneven. The dredging winches are driven by powerful belting from a lever-controlled engine, while the lowering brakes for the ladders have been designed with different settings that allow the winchman to lower each ladder gradually or stop it suddenly in case of an emergency.","Improvements in Sydney Harbor

Business people and others familiar with the harbor, the steam dredge, and other appliances used in connection with deepening operations on the eastern side of Circular Quay will, doubtless, be glad to learn that the work has been completed. The work has been in progress for about two years. It will be remembered that the building of three sections of new wharves was finished about 10 or 12 months ago, two of the sections being about 600 feet in length, and the other (the ""container"" section) 800 feet. Opposite the wharf, it has been necessary to secure a depth of 20 feet at low water spring tides. For some time past, attention has been devoted to that portion of Sydney Cove which is bounded on the east by the central section of the wharf. It has been necessary to blast and dredge rock in some places to a depth of 10 feet. The work has not been continuous and has been carried out only as opportunity would allow; otherwise, it would doubtless have been completed much sooner.

The whole of the work, with the exception of the dredging, been carried out under the supervision of Mr. Alfred W liauiB, Assistant Engineer for Harbours and Rivers, at the dredging has been executed under the direction of Mr. A. B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredges. The Orient Company took possession of their new wharf yesterday. The next work of importance to which the Hatboutaacl Rivers Department will be directly involved will be the dredging of the Gurdon, which was completed in May. We are informed by Mr. A. G. Bowerman, of the Orient Company, that all the parts of the project were carried out under the direction of Mr. A. Bowerman, Director of Harbours and Rivers. The work on the Gurdon is proceeding apace. The steamer Poona has arrived, and is engaged in a voyage of three days. The last cargo arrived on November 27th, and will be delivered in mid-winter. The last work will be the removal of the steam dredge which was to be undertaken by the Orient Company; and the steamer will be followed by the locomotive which has been moved to the Hobart-point wharf. With respect to the Gurdon, it is thought that the work has been carried out very satisfactorily; but it is hoped that the improvements which have been made are well attended by the authorities in the country, and that a larger vessel may be dispatched to the wharf to be employed in this part of the port. The vessel in question is called Poona, and is a two-horse steam ship, with two engines; the ship will be of a smaller than usual height, being about the size of a _____-boat, and can haul up to 6,000 tons. It was formerly owned by the Sydney Railway. Her age is, according to the records of the Railway Company, twenty-eight years. In this respect she appears to be well fitted for operations with respect to steaming and inroads; the vessel is well maintained and is well stocked; and has the most compact dimensions, being about the same height as the steamer Poona. It is a good deal cheaper than the Poona, with the greatest savings being in the fact that it will be able to carry in the steamer the largest load of iron ore the Orient Company could possibly make. The Gurdon is about the size of an ordinary boat, and has a diameter of 8'6"" and a length of 3'6"". She is powered by three boilers of two cylinders each, each with a capacity of 25.000 tons. The engines are all fitted with a steam-engined boiler, and the steam-engined steam-turbine is designed to produce 8,000 tins of coal in two seconds. The vessel has had the service of an officer, as a westerly-searcher, for about two years, and her cargo is of good value. It has been taken from Sydney and shipped to Hobart and New South Wales, where the steam-engine, with which it was employed, was manufactured. The vessel is on the run from Sydney to Hobart, and has not been taken on board more than once in the year. It has been in the harbor of Hobart for several weeks, and is on board for the next two weeks. At Hobart the vessel has been towed about 150 ft. by the Orient Company. The Orient Company is very much concerned with the improvement of the wharf and the preparation of it. The steamer Poona will be employed as the vessel under the direction of Mr. Bowerman for the purposes of the work on the Gurdon, when the Orient Company is allowed the opportunity to obtain the most favourable terms for her. Her speed is between 6'2"" and 12'1"". The Orient Company has been very agreeable in their assistance. The steamer is a little lighter than the Poona. It weighs about the same as the Poona, and is a good deal lighter. The steamer is powered by two boilers of two cylinders each, each with a capacity of 10,000 tons. It is designed to produce 8,000 tins of coal in two seconds. The ship will be in the harbor of Hobart for the next two weeks. The steamer is on the run from Sydney to Hobart, and has not been taken on board more than once in the year. It is intended that she should have been taken in Hobart and to Hobart on her voyage, and, by her having been on the run, could have been brought up on board the Orient Company at no great expense. The steamer is on the run from Hobart to Sydney, and has not been taken on board more than once in the year. It has been on the run for the past six weeks. It has not been taken on board more than once in the year. A. Bowerman, director of the Orient Company, has been appointed to carry out the work. The Orient Company has agreed to the most favourable terms for the vessel, and are endeavoring to obtain a good price for it. The steamer Poona will be taken in Hobart and to New South Wales on her voyage, and the Orient Company is going to supply the steamer with some supplies of iron ore, with the intention of making",OPT-350M,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-facebook-opt-350m.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.25,-0.7281629455542499,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.5054982817869416,-0.45387225149207183,80-99%,-0.6358229076859608,Negative Improvement,1584,847,"Incorrectly written: lower the heavy ladders.

The next work of importance to which the Hatboutaacl Rivers Department will direct their attention Is the building of the mote extension to the wharf opposite Phillip-street, wharf in the immediate vicinity of the dock of Messageries Maritimes. This is to be done with the view of extending the wharf, which was formerly a dry dock, so as to provide more room for the discharge of ships. A contract was let a week or two ago for the erection of this extension. The erection is to be done by contract, and the work is to be of a large character, and will be the first step towards improving the facilities for the discharge of ships at the Circular Quay Docks. We understand that a tender for the work has already been sent in, and we may safely expect to see the work well executed.</s>",OPT-6.7B,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.9085014409221902,-0.012142577359968666,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.8326163472819711,-0.10046204409523152,80-99%,-0.08074475036160991,Negative Improvement,905,847,"lower the heavy ladders inch by inch to the

On the contrary wharf, which has been leased to the Orient S Navigation Company, there has been erected a bargain 200 foot in length. 40 feet in width, uudhavingítü height of about '20 feet. The shed is open at para! ; ta is to be enclosed with doors. A shed of a similar strip. tion is to be erected on the Messageries Maritimes Wharf, and two others will be built upon the Phillip-street seeds of the wharf, which is used for general shipping. The whole of the work, with the exception of the dredging, been carried out under the supervision of Mr. Alfred W liauiB, Assistant Engineer for Harbours and Rivers, at the dredging has been executed under the direction of Mr. A. B.- Portus, Inspector of Dredging in Portsmouth. Mr. A. B.- has, as far as is known, carried out dredging under similar conditions on the Thames at several places; and it will be interesting to see how far he has been able to perfect the use of this ingenious contrivance. It may be mentioned that at a meeting of the Engineers for Harbours and Rivers held at Portsmouth in September last Mr. B- Portus made a special announcement in connection with his plans for the establishment of a school of navigation in the city. This announcement will doubtless lead to the establishment of an institution of this kind. The harbour committee of the council of Melbourne have appointed a commission of three to consider the construction of a wharf at the wharf which is to be extended at St. Kilda. The wharf, which is now about 160 feet in length, by reason of the peculiar nature of the sand bottom, is frequently damaged during heavy storms by being lifted or swept away in the waves. The present wharf was built by the Government in 1865, and was intended for light and dry goods and general merchandise, and it was intended that a large building for dry goods should be erected at the western end. There has, however, been no attempt to construct this building. The committee have appointed Mr. E. J. Hall, of Woolworths, as secretary. He is expected to report to the council of Melbourne on the subject.
JANUARY 12.-There have been several inquiries made to the Government regarding the construction of a wharf at the Port of St. Kilda. A contract for the erection of a wharf was originally prepared in 1861, but the amount was so large that it was impossible to accept it at the time. In March last the council decided that the matter should be referred to the government for approval, but no action has yet been taken.</s>",BLOOM-7.1B,prompt_complex_01,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-7b1.jsonl,0.9196685878962536,0.0007204610951008645,-0.9992166079122601,80-99%,0.9256044637321761,0.7083608724388631,-0.2347045631320253,80-99%,-0.660075138400869,Negative Improvement,1070,847,"lower the heavy ladders inch by inch to the work.
