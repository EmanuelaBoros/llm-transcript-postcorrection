A PLEASANT HISTORIE very glad that the young man had desired to be but a student of his order. So he took him aside, and taught him well to be a good servant and an honest man. And that this world is as good as any other, and that it is so very short, that it is to be spent and not to be wasted. Then the young man began to make good use of his instructions, and was at all times ready to obey, as the Priour directed, with all his heart, and all his body, and all his soul. And when he was long used and brought to hew by the young man, he began to speak well of the order, and was so pleased, that he began to hew so well, that the young man could no longer endure the thought that he was so much used. So he began to tell him some of the great faults and sorrows of the order, and how they be in great danger of destruction. And as the young man knew well all that the Priour said, he told the young man what a great treasure he had in his house, which he would gladly give him, and that all his house, and all his goods, and all his goods, and his wife and all his children, and all his friends, would be glad to give him if he would ask for it. Then the Priour told the young man, what an honour and an advantage to him and his brethren, was to be put into his hands. And the young man, without delay, asked for the treasure, and all that it contained, which he was so good as to deliver. And it was a great treasure, and they came out of the house and put it into the young man's hands, with all the riches of the Priour's house. And after all had been given into the young man's hands, the Priour led the young man into the house and left him there. And when he had departed the young man bade his brethren farewell, and went with his friend into the town, and spent all the day in gadding and drinking. Then his friends came back to him and told him all that he had spent with the young man, and the treasure that was in his house.

I was curious to see if there is any history behind them, especially because there are few or no historical documents on this topic.
While searching, I was able to find two articles that mention this topic, both of which were not available in our library's online databases. Here is the full text of one article:

On November 10, 1781, a group of religious men gathered in Paris to form the Society of Jesus. In January of 1782, a small group of the Society of Jesus visited France's Holy Land to find historical accounts of Christian lives during the Middle Ages. They collected documents to write their own history, the Holy Lives of Jesus Christ and His Saints. They compiled and edited the document that is the subject of this study.
In this study, the author looks at the Holy Lives to see if there is any history behind the stories that are told. She finds that many of the stories are true and that there is little doubt that some of them have historical roots. In the end, she concludes that much of the history of the Saints is a mystery, with little proof of a time and place for the events and some of the stories just being fictional.
The Holy Lives of Jesus Christ and His Saints, which was originally called the History of the Blessed Virgin and the Saints, is an edited document compiled and published in French in 1782 by Ignatius and Peter Martyr, Jesuits. The original manuscript was in French. In 1784, Ignatius and Peter Martyr sent this manuscript to their French counterpart, Father Charles de Ferrières, for the purpose of translation. The translation, which was based on the original French text, was completed in 1788. Ignatius died on January 22, 1795, and the translation was never published. In 1814, Ignatius's brother, Ignatius of Loyola, was asked by Ignatius's disciple, Father William Henry Brindley, to reprint the text. The first edition of the Holy Lives was published on March 1, 1814. The first edition of the Holy Lives contained four hundred and fifty-one pages.
The publication of this work was an act of faith for the Jesuits, who believed that it was a Christian document. Father Brindley, in a letter to Ignatius, wrote:

In the above extract there is much that is obviously corrupt and unsuitable. But as it shows in baldest outline the scheme of the allegory and satire in the graceful fable of the "" Pleasaunt History,"" and of Drayton's general tendency in his writing, it is given in the Appendix. Drayton's pamphlets are indicative of the views of himself and his set at this time, that all was adrift, and in which very few were gainers save the relatives of Henry VHI and themselves. That some at least saw that these reforms or changes were crying out to be set right, appears from the following poems purporting to be written at this epoch.

And the Priour went in after the young man to his house, and there he gave the young man all his goods, and with that he wrought a church, and the monastery.

THE KING AND THE PRIESTESS
That night Rush went to bed in the garret, and had not long lain there before he saw a dainty lamb which came in and kissed him upon the mouth and went away againe. The next morning betimes Rush went up to the Priour, and made his humble compliment of thankes. That morning in the mass, the Priour preached a sermon of the twelve principal virtues and the vices of mankinde. And in the midst of his sermon he stood up and called for silence, and then said, that every man in this assembly should see with what a world of vices that the world is full of all. In the morning Rush rose up betimes and went to hear matins and mass at the high alter, and after he came to the middle altar, and kneeled down to say his prayers, at the which time he heard one of the brothers say, who was there, that all men were fools, and that they knew nothing of their own matters. Then said he, I know of what I speak, for I am a cunning fellow, and know very well what I am going about. When he had ended his sayings, he went to the chapel door, and was there a while ad alone.

This devil was put in raiment like an earthly creature and went to a religious house, and there he stood at the gate for a certain space all alone, with a heavy countenance.

Rush lived among the religious men and did his best to maintain their unseemly way of living. He was skillful at keeping the secrets of the religious men, and they came to trust him completely. Rush continued his work for years, and the religious men grew more and more corrupt under his influence.

One day, the Priour became gravely ill. Rush was by his side, assisting him in any way he could. As the Priour lay dying, he grabbed Rush's hand and told him that he had been a faithful servant, but his sins were too great for him to be forgiven.

Rush was thrown into an abyss and was forced to stay there for the rest of his days. The religious men were left to repent for their wicked ways, and they renewed their commitment to holiness and prayer.

<poem style=""margin-left: 2em;"">With the King I went a-hunting from month to month.
Then sport gave place unto a courtier's life;
And, except such hours as filled up with a browse
About our pleasant neighbour streamlets, were in truth
But grief for mighty friends, or most and least
A sentence stern or right, as king to oflfend,
As partial law unto the tempted. But, man
Give them the past they will not learn the future,
And on his tomb King Alfred carved a prophecy,
Though many a mutineer might lean to Dis
Because he cheated him of his due.
True English heart, that did not fail in time of need,
And, if "" at Alfred's Court they learnt courtesy,""
There oft they pluck'd the statute natural down
As with a Tudor's hand the Misselden toil.

The sunset of a life that taught us how sublime
By grace of duty and of decent state
Would brighten but to prove that his was thine;

TEXT TO CORRECT:

OF BOUVE. He was called Rue, and was said to be a true servant. He had great service and a good and fair name to be given him, and many good and well servants. This was to be the time for his brother, and after he had done this he would return to his brother's home, and would put to his backe the right and the name that he thought fit. So, when he had done this he would leave his brother's house to his backe; and, as we have had to do and he have had time to do it, he would lay up a backe to take care of his brother's brother. If there were more that we doe, this is he, I would take away any such servant of my brother's brother's house that was to be my brother in my household. But, if no such servant of my brother's brother's home was my brother, I would take away this servant, and make a name for him in my home to come and serve my brother's brother. So I take away any servant that was that was not so called.

It was to say unto the Lord, ""Be pleased in this land, to have brought in the man that shall be in me in thy place and in the charge of thy body, or the body of thy brother. For this I am with thee in thy strength, and in thy death I am with thee."" The Lord said, ""Be pleased in thy strength, and in thy death I am with thee.""
""Then I will make a confession to thy Lord and Master, and to thy brethren. They who are to have the Lord's place, shall be called to thy side, and they that are to be in the charge of thy body, shall be called to thy side.""
The Lord said, ""But I will make the oath that this man is mine, and my own father, and my own son. He shall not die, and his name shall not be sanctified, nor his body shall be made holy, but his name shall be sanctified by the blood of his mother and his father.""
So the Lord said, ""Now now this man shall be called, the man that I have brought to thee, and to thy body. For this man hath no place with me in my Lord, and in the place of my Lord, nor the body of my Lord, nor the place of my lord, and not the place of my son, nor the body of my son.

The MS. is so imperfect, that this part of the story cannot be perfectly known, but what it seems to intimate is, that on those days the Friers used to fight with Rush's truncheons. "" How Rush died of the poxe"" is copied in like manner. Frier Rush died at the time of the great pestilence in 1349, and this passage seems to refer to the custom of the Friers going to bury the dead of the pestilence. We give a facsimile of a part of the MS. underneath this. There are also several notes, as follows:— "" A mss of the year 1450. In the college library at Oxford.

One day, as he was walking in the garden, he saw a tree that had been cut down and decided to make truncheons out of it. He carved the wood into weapons and gave them to the friars, telling them that they should use them to defend themselves if necessary.

The friars were pleased with the truncheons and thanked Rush. However, they soon discovered that the truncheons were magical and would strike anyone who was not a true believer in the Christian faith. The friars were amazed by this and thought that Rush must have made a pact with the devil to create such powerful weapons.

They accused Rush of witchcraft and brought him before the Prior for trial. Rush denied making any pact with the devil and said that the truncheons were simply made from a piece of wood. However, the friars refused to believe him and decided to burn him at the stake for his alleged crimes.

On the day of his execution, Rush prayed to God for help. Suddenly, a miracle occurred and the truncheons sprouted into full-grown trees, which shielded Rush from the flames. The Prior and the friars were awestruck by the miracle and proclaimed Rush to be a saint.

From that day forward, the friars venerated Rush as a holy man, and his tomb became a place of pilgrimage. The truncheons that he had made were displayed as relics, and people came from far and wide to see them. Rush had gone from being a humble cook to a revered saint, all because of his faith and dedication to his calling.",0.9709631728045326,0.2817089452603471,-0.7098664983897811,GPT-3.5,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.4681448963048427,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl

Cf. the book of Jeremiah, and the text of Acts, it is also said that the term was originally called ""Quintilent"" in the book of Jeremiah, but then was changed to be pronounced ""Quentilent"" by Paul Bovary (cf. the first part of his ""History and Reformed Life,"" vol. ii., p. 97, and p. 97). A common opinion is, that the term ""Quintilent"" has been used by James to denote the name of the prophet who has not yet been recorded. However, there is no evidence, in the above quote or from the words of Paul Bovary, to indicate otherwise. In the book of Acts, we learn that the word ""Quintilent"" is spoken by a friend, who was a prophet and a follower of James, in which words are found in every passage of that language: ""And the people of Jerusalem and Judea [for the city of Judah] were not allowed to give to their brethren who were in the house of the Lord their hau: and ye saw the Lord give unto his brethren, and ye gave unto the house of their brethren, and ye said unto the Lord, We will give ye this city for our hau, and for this house our hau, and the city of Judah for our hau.""

Over the space of seven years, Friar Rush worked diligently in the monastery's kitchen and endeared himself to everyone. One day, during a general council meeting, the Prior remembered Rush and said to his brethren, ""Friends, we have here Rush, our master cook who has been a faithful and hardworking servant. He has been with us for longer than any other servant, and it is fitting that we promote him to another office and make him a brother among us."" The entire convent agreed, and so the Prior sent for Rush. When Rush arrived, the Prior and his brethren told him of their decision and invited him to become a brother, which he accepted with gratitude.

In the first century, Rush was a general, and after the death of William he became its successor. When Frier William died in 924, the abbey, the province and the state of Northumbria united to recognize Rush as their abbot and abbess. He also gave the abbey of Fretwell a charter for its independence and in the same year made a truce with William of Hereford. The same year, Rush, a relative of William of Normandy and the leader of the people of Lincolnshire in rebellion against the Norman King Richard II, died. Frier William, a brother of Frier Rush, became the abbot, and the abbey of Fretwell was also united to him.

From the time of his discovery he was much larger and much more savage than a man of this age, and had much more bones than a man of the earth. So that he had the appearance of a man that was as old as the sea-monster that fought him, but was a little younger, because of his being smaller than his body.

But let me see if thou canst stand thee, and then shall thy power be, and I will give thee this name as well.""

They are not very strong, but that they are, if you take the one that I have given you here I am very sure they can be brought to power; but they are also very easy. The Hke had taken the first of these on the occasion of their return from the voyage of the dragon and his entreaties. It was an old lady with a tall stature; with hair of a thick-set brow, but the eye was a black. Her face was painted green, her eyes green and her cheeks full of eyes that resembled his own, and in her breast an eagle-shaped star. She said nothing to the contrary; she spoke only to the Hke in a calm voice: "" I will send my children to the gods to see for themselves. You will see how these things are done."" Then the Hke, as the dragon went to fetch the horse, and as he came, went down and saw all the houses that were in such houses that he could not but see them. He saw that the houses were the same as those that the dragon came, the roofs all white and tall with trees, and a large quantity of wood",0.9743926460932372,0.26,-0.7331671159029649,GPT-2,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.7397719637485839,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-gpt2.jsonl

George, who fought with a dragon and killed it, inspired Vandermast to follow his example and raise Perseus, who also fought a sea monster and killed it, freeing themselves from danger. Not content with their display of skill, they delved further into their conjuring and summoned two spirits each. Bungye commanded his spirit to assist him with its greatest power so he could overcome Vandermast. The Devil agreed to help if Bungye gave him three drops of blood from his left arm, warning that Vandermast would have power over him if he refused. Vandermast's Devil made the same demand, and the two agreed, thinking they could overcome each other, but the Devil outsmarted them both. Having given the Devil the blood, as previously mentioned, they resumed their conjuring. Bungye summoned Achilles and his Greeks, who threatened Vandermast with their march. Vandermast raised Hector and his Trojans, who defended him against Achilles and the Greeks. A great battle ensued between the Greeks and Trojans, and although Hector fell, the Trojans fled. A great storm followed, with thunder and lightning, and the two conjurers wished they were elsewhere.

But it shall come to pass when this world shall be over, that thou shalt have thy rest, but then shall not a man suffer.—O that I were dead, the dragon said, that I might not have been able to come to thy side and say this thing unto thee.—No, O my brother, said the Devil, I am so great a thing, that thou shalt never be able to come to my side.—Why then said the Devil, that is because thou hast not yet come to know me.

They both thought their thoughts, that they were now to come together to fight for the throne. And as they knew that they had been so good to the Hke, they said, that if we both should come and fight for the throne, if the Hke would grant us that then he would be our Hke; and if he would not, then he would not be. If a man shall say to me that if I do not grant him that, then I will not grant him another one, the one that comes from me will go away from my hand and no longer come. That is why they say, that the time is come when they will fight for the throne, for the Hke will grant them that. So then the Hke told them, that if they both were to fight, if their Hke would grant them both and would not grant them both, the two will then become friends and fight each other till their death. But as to the Hke himself, he did not believe they would ever fight with him againe. But did they ever be able to hear the harking of a thunder of lightning, as it sounded to them, which came in great thunder, and that a man could not hear it? Or the sound of the thunder, that as it sounded to the Hke, it was like a flame of fire, that he could not catch fire for but half a snail's length. So then the Hke did tell them of this, that they should not fight the more than they could do.

of fried bacon:
The first, and most notable of all the dishes that are to be found in every house of fried bacons, is that which is called the butter bacon, as it is more than a farrago of fresh butter, with a very little of bread or cakes, which being made into a batter, and put in a pan or dish, and afterwards being roasted, is called a fried bacon. It is a most pleasant and dainty dish to be found in every house. The ingredients that go to make it, are as follow:
Cake
Bread or Cakes

Bread
The breads that go to make the batter are those that are called white, which are made in the country, and that have the quality of being fresh, and without any foreign impurities. The bakers make the batter by working the bread and baking it together with water, and other ingredients, to make it fit for use in frying, and as it is made for frying, it has the property of being baked in a much shorter time than bread baked by itself, and is also much more pliable and dainty. The cakes that are used in making the batter are those that are called short, that are baked in the ordinary way. There are two kinds of cakes that are used in frying, that is to say, a pound cake and a pound cumbrian, which are made by baking the cakes in the same way as bread, but in a much less quantity. The cakes that are baked in the cumbrian form are generally very sweet, and are eaten with sweet butter. The cake and bread are so well balanced together, that it is very seldom that the bread is separated from the cake before it is roasted. In the last place it is to be noted that the cake is made into batter, by adding to it a very little of the water that goes to make the batter, and then to this batter the butter is added.

The other of the ingredients that go to make the batter, is a good deal of butter, and this is placed in the batter in the same way as bread is put into the batter.

As you can see I have tried to provide a few examples of errors which are present in the documents that I need to transcribe, but it is quite clear to me that even if I have an entire manual available, that I will need a lot of time and work to correct all of the errors. Is there a better way to transcribe documents, and would you recommend using a professional transcriptionist?

A sentence is just a sentence.  The phrase ""to make a sentence"" is a sentence.
In my experience, this is a difficult one for most editors to understand and solve.
If you want to write a sentence you have to break it up into sentences.
If it doesn't look like your sentences are broken then you'll have a very small chance of getting a score.
I'm not suggesting that you need to write a sentence to be a good text editor.

Hector was slain by his friend, but was freed from it by the Demon of the Sea. Hector was restored from the fire by the Spirit of the Fire. When they had arrived, Hector was carried on his sword and had his helmet off, so that the Demon could not see that the man was a Hero. The Demon of the Sea was said to have done with Hector, because he had given Hector a good deal of knowledge of the sea, and had not heeded his orders? Well, if it were not for Hector, and his Troians and his friends, he would not have had this knowledge.

Text 2 The Legend of St George Text 2 The Legend of St George The story of St George is an old one, and people tell the story in many different ways. This story is about George, who is called George, because he was a knight in King Arthur’s army. The knights all wore the name of the saint whose day they were born on. George’s birthday was the 23rd of April, so he was named after St George. St George was a kind and noble knight, who did not fight only for gold or for glory, but for his Christian beliefs. One day the king commanded George to kill a terrible dragon which was terrorizing a village. George disobeyed the king, for he could not bring himself to kill the dragon. Soon after this George set out on a journey. In the town where he was staying, the king was preparing a great banquet for the emperor. George was invited, but as he entered the hall, he was struck blind by a spell cast by the evil emperor. The emperor then killed the king, for he was in love with the queen, the king’s wife. George, however, was set free by the king’s ghost. When George was restored to sight by the king, he fought a great battle against the evil emperor.

After this the Devill was ordered to dismount, and took leave of his servants, which he was to give to their father and mother, who took leave of him, and all three took leave of his servants. Then the Devill, by this means, gained power over his subjects, and by that way made the Devill pay for the knowledge that he had gained, and to that end the Devill took leave of his servants, and they took leave of him, which they said was from his side, and he thus paid for the knowledge that he had gained, and it shall be remembered that the Devill did not return to his master's house. That he did not return was, but a little time after, that the Devill made haste to his master, to seek the Devill's services to assist him in a work which he did, as he said so; and he made haste with him to the Devill, for his master told him the Devill was here, and told him to make haste with him and seek him, and for the sake of the knowledge that he had gained he made haste with the Devill, which he did do for three days, and the Devill returned after the Devill's return.

The same demand was made by Vandermast's Devil to Bungye's spirit. Both agreed, thinking to overcome each other, but the Devil overthrew them both. Having given the Devil their blood, they returned to their conjurations.

First, Bungye raised Achilles with his Greeks, who threatened Vandermast. Then, Vandermast raised Hector with his Trojans, who defended him from Achilles and the Greeks. This led to a great battle between the Greeks and Trojans, which lasted a while. In the end, Hector was slain, and the Trojans fled.

Then followed a great tempest with thunder and lightning, so the two conjurers wished they were away. But wishes were in vain, for the time had come to pay the Devil for the knowledge he had imparted.",0.9743926460932372,0.67,-0.3123921832884097,GPT-3.5,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.2723932747427964,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl

Then did they go to the King, and besought him that they might be put into some prison to helpe them from the cruel Devil, who had got so much of their blood, that their spirits were almost gone. He sent for them, and committed them into the Tower, and locked them up.

“I am going to die,” replied the hermit.
“You have been here for many years. Why do you leave now?” asked the angel.
“I am finished with my time here,” said the hermit.
“But are you not finished with your time on earth?” asked the angel.

He was a horse bred in the island of Chios, which was of such a nature that when it was in his hand, his strength was such that he was able to overturn all things.

It is well known by the histories of those times, that they two spirits were taken to be the two first of the seven, of which the seventh is now in the world. And they are called Etrurians. They are not to be called so, but Greekes, as some authors of this kind doe. And the names of the spirits were Apollo, Venus, Mars, Mercury, Mercury, Juno, Saturn, Mars, Vulcan, Pluto, Lucifer, the Dragon, the Dragon, the Dragon, the Dragon. From hence it is inferred, that the first of these spirits, which was called Apollo, was the god of light and heaUening, as many other authors doe affirm. And the next that came was called Venus, whose name is now commonly used for the goddess of the fair sex, and so she is in most countries, as well in the English nation, as in the Greekes. And in the same way is Venus now used for the fair sex in the Italianes, the Spaniards, and the Portuguese. In the Latins she is called Diana, which is the name of one of their great gods. Now the reason that Venus was called the fair Sex, because it is thought that the fair sex have more skill in the arts of war, and in such like coniurations, then those who are of another colour. And they that are of another colour are of weaker and less strength, and for that reason are most easily handled. For the same reason they are also called women, which the Greeks and Latins doe mean to be so, although they doe not use that name for the same.

Their first task being to make a camp, their second was to fight the Demons, who had been in their hearts of hearts. As they fought one of the Demons fell on the earth. And as the demoniacs had taken the form of a dragon, and thus had brought the Demons with them, the devils and the men of the earth took them up and with them they fought them, but as the Demons were of the highest power and of that which can best be seen, they were so much overcome by their combat that they did not dare to fight. The fight of the Demons had continued for three days, and at the third day of the battle, when the men of the earth heard the fight and the thunder which was falling, they fell on both the demoniacs and the heroes. Then the men of the earth and the devils were so overcome by their combat that they were ready for their retreat. The devils had raised up a great fire, which was made a sort of fire, which the men of the earth could not resist; so that as they were near the fire they fell asleep in a cloud, and with their sleep they fell asleep in a cloud. They knew that the smoke was coming and they were so overcome by their fight that the devils did not dare to go to war with the men of the earth. So the devils went and fought the men of the earth till one day, as they were near the mountains and there was a flame, they fell asleep and the flames broke out from their sleep.

The dragon being the highest of all,Width had more and stronger arms than the others. The Dragon stood at his base and to his left the dragons were standing on his tail, that his head and his head should touch his body, and his belly should touch his body. And then he saw that the Hke was not afraid of the dragon as he was in that battle, so the dragon was about the whole height of the Hke's height. The Dragon was a wise man, and not afraid of anything of his own kind.

The two Dragons that stood at his base saw the Hke fly to him with two wings and his left side and his right side, and to the side of his head and the right side of his tail that dragon was standing at the same height as the Hke's. As the two dragons were standing at the same height, the Hke turned on its tail and came, and said, In this manner was the dragon able to fly, which he had not before seen in a manner that the dragon could not do, and that it, in the way of wings and tail, had no fear of being chased by the Hke when it went.

In an inscription by M. J. Langone dated to the 5th of July of 623, the dragon of the north was named ""Bungye,"" to mean ""Great of all, swift of flight."" There is no indication that this may have occurred, but it appears to have been in use among the hke of the hke of a similar character.

Mais je savais bien qu'il n'y par-tirait pas. Je le sentais. Je savais qu'il allait m'attirer plus de torts que de bien, il voulait me faire peur, il voulait me tourmenter, il voulait être mon époux. J'allais lui dire oui, et je ne pourrais plus jamais lui dire non. Je croyais le plus fort, je croyais tout le contraire. Il me disait qu'il m'avait toujours aimée, mais en secret. En vérité, il le sentait trop bien pour me le dire ouvertement il n'avait jamais eu de cesse de me flatter, je l'avais toujours cru capable de bien faire mais à cause de ce passé, de mon orgueil je ne lui avais pas parlé. Je le croyais trop bien pour faire des sottises, j'avais des principes bien fixés. Il ne m'avait pas dit qu'il était venu chez moi, et je croyais que c'était une blague. Au lieu de cela il m'a tout avoué. Il m'a dit qu'il me devait tout, que son coeur était à moi. Il ne m'a pas encore dit pourquoi mais il va me le dire, il va bientôt. Il me pardonnera. Il me dit qu'il regrette de ne pas avoir eu cette occasion, mais qu'il a su ce qu'il lui fallait faire, et que tout lui sera pardonné. Je suis sûre qu'il m'aime encore et que je serai la femme de sa vie. Mais il va me dire quelque chose que je n'attendais pas il va me dire qu'il va se marier et que nous nous embarquerons pour l'Amérique. Il veut me faire peur, mais ce n'est pas lui, c'est moi qui m'embarque. Le secret est bien gardé. Quand je l'aurai compris je lui dirai tout. Je suis sûre que je vais l'aimer, je suis sûre qu'il va me donner une fiatre, je suis sûre que je serai heureuse. Mais je suis plus que sûre qu'il veut se marier, je ne lui demanderai pas de me laisser le temps de décider. Nous nous embarquerons, il me laissera une fiatre et je prendrai la plus grande. Je l'aimerai encore, mais il me faudra me séparer de lui. Je ne veux pas être avec lui, je n'en peux plus de lui. Mais ce qui m'attend au loin est trop beau pour le perdre. Si je n'accepte pas ce qu'il veut me faire j'ai tout à fait le droit de me venger. J'aimerais mieux qu'il meure plutôt que que je me sépare de lui. Mon mari ne m'avait pas fait tant de cadeaux, mais mon coeur était libre. Je ne veux pas rester seule sans lui et sans mon mari. Je veux qu'il revienne, et je veux lui dire que je l'aime encore. Mais je n'ai pas de temps à perdre, il faut que je réfléchisse. Je vais voir le médecin, c'est la seule façon de savoir. Mais il n'est plus temps maintenant, je vais lui dire de venir nous voir. Mais il m'a juré qu'il me quittait pour l'Amérique, mais, au nom du ciel, qu'il est vrai, où est le médecin qui pourra guérir mon coeur? Je suis sûre qu'il va venir.

\strong{L'éventualité de sa destruction par la guerre mondiale, voilà une de nos préoccupations les plus vives. Il y a deux ans, nous disions que l'avenir de la France nous inquiétait.

Melchior had just taken leave of his friends and was not at all tired of his easy ways. He took it on himself to invite us all to leave all our troubles behind us. Not that there was anything serious about the matter, nor was there anything dangerous for any of us, but that good fellow had thrown on our attention a little bit of life and movement, and had made my grandmother happy, and she, on her part, had smiled as though all this were a very delightful distraction. Not that I knew anything about it, and in return I forgot all the little annoyances that he had given me before, his impertinence, his air evaporated, his pipes, his stockings, and his whiskers. He won over all our hearts in spite of himself, and he kept it up to the moment when he left us. I was a long way from expecting it, and I did not think there was anything serious about it, either for me or for you. But he had thrown a little something on our attention, and this was serious enough to him, and dangerous for some of us. I was a long way from being afraid, and I was very near giving in when my grandfather came to his rescue. I was already on the second floor when the light failed him altogether. I rushed down to the first and caught hold of him to find out what was the matter, but he was gone, leaving me alone in darkness with a terrified little woman. Then I knew that we were in danger, and I made a rush for the window in order to prevent her from falling. He himself had nothing to fear, since he knew how to keep himself safe, but he left us without a word of good-bye, which he might well have done. That was the end of the matter, for already the last words had been exchanged, and I was already going up the stairway when the light went out altogether. Was that him? Was it the wish? What was it? I never saw him again, but, at the moment when darkness came, I felt the hand seized on my shoulders and drew me back. I saw a big shadow falling on me and felt an embrace about my neck. Was it him?

remettre ma vengeance à plus tard. Mais la grand'mère ne m'en laissa pas le temps. Elle me demanda brusquement ce que j'avais, en me regardant avec inquiétude. Je ne pus répondre de ce que j'avais, et me réfugiai dans un silence gêné. L'impression qu'elle avait sur moi fut, je crois, si vive que je m'en gardai pour plus tard et n'en parlai jamais. Ce jour-là je ne pus supporter plus longtemps le silence imposé par le désir que j'avais de dire, et de lui dire, ce que je sentais. La vie et le monde me parurent d'une étrangeté nouvelle; et ce fut comme si, à cette époque-là, on m'avait ouvert les yeux sur le monde extérieur. En ce sens, on peut dire sans exagération que ce jour-là j'eus une révélation. Mais le lendemain, lorsque Melchior revint, je pus être tout à fait sincère et lui parler à cœur ouvert. Je ne lui cachai rien et il parut satisfait, ce qui ne l'empêcha pas de me reprendre quand nous nous remîmes ensemble. A-t-il eu honte? Je n'en sais rien; mais, en tout cas, il me prit, malgré moi, dans ses bras et me laissa là, les larmes aux yeux, et le visage défait, sans pouvoir parler ni le premier, ni le dernier mot. Je ne savais pas trop si je l'avais trahi ou s'il avait su trahir mon secret. Mais ce que je sais, c'est que, le soir venu, je l'avais retrouvé tout près de moi, dans le grand lit que nous avions, et que je n'avais pu me défaire de lui.

CE QU'ON PEUT VOIR DANS UNE RUE

Ce fut une joie d'avoir été compris, et de ne point le savoir. Le silence, le repos, la douceur même de cette nuit, ne m'avaient laissé aucun doute sur le sentiment de notre amour, et sur la confiance qui régnait entre nous. Auparavant, j'avais vécu une vie de luttes et de sacrifices, mais je n'avais jamais connu de joie réelle, et quand je pensais que je l'avais enfin trouvée, je me sentais toute triste et désappointée. Cela n'était pourtant pas la fin. Ce n'était que le commencement. Tout d'un coup il avait disparu. Il était parti. Il ne venait plus au logis et ne m'avait jamais reparu. Je me sentis livrée à moi-même, comme abandonnée au monde et à ses misères. On se trouvait sans défense et on était seule avec soi-même, sans plus de lien et de secours que les plus malheureux. Sans cela, à vrai dire, tout allait bien; car le lendemain, quand je lui demandai pardon de ma trahison, il ne me regarda pas autrement que les autres et je n'ai jamais su s'il y avait répondu. Mais quand il me sembla qu'il s'était tourné vers moi d'un regard plein de pitié, je compris que je l'avais aimé, qu'il m'avait aimée, et que notre amour n'avait pas eu d'existence, mais seulement une valeur imaginaire, la plus pure et la plus haute que nous pouvions avoir, sans pouvoir y toucher. Je sentis alors, je crois, comme une sorte de révolte, et je ne sais si ce fut parce qu'il ne m'avait rien dit",0.988219895287958,0.3016427822439706,-0.6947614759809357,BLOOM-7.1B,prompt_complex_lang,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.7396884302981601,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-bigscience-bloom-7b1.jsonl

13. Melchior se croyait encore dangereux. J'eusse été assez heureuse, après un long silence, de le voir revenir; mais ce n'était pas sa coutume, et on en pouvait donc conclure que ma position était réellement compromise. J'étais bien résolue à ne pas le laisser revenir, à lui jeter la porte à la figure et à l'écon-temple de manière à lui faire regretter une fois encore d'avoir quitté Paris. Je pris une chandelle pour me rendre à mon chevet et passai, en me déshabillant, dans la chambre de la grand'mère. J'avais l'intention de lui demander des comptes de ses dé-marches du matin. Je le lui fis aussitôt, et je vis qu'elle n'avait pas du tout l'idée que j'étais mécontentée de son petit protégé. J'étais bien étonné moi-même de ce que je disais. Mais je la trouvai si enchantante et si fraîche, la pauvre mère, et elle avait tant de choses à me dire de l'après-midi, que je me décidai à lui dissimuler l'humeur avec laquelle j'avais reçu Melchior. Pendant le souper, au milieu de tant de gens, je vis avec surprise la grand'mère très-amusée de moi et ne manquant jamais l'occasion de me rappeler que nous allions dîner à l'avenir chez nous, et que, par conséquent, les invités à déjeûner n'étaient plus que des invités à dîner. J'entendis aussi une phrase, dont j'aurais bien aimé me rappeler le sens exact, je me rappelai bien qu'elle allait au profit de Melchior, que la grand'mère me voulait en ce moment, qu'elle voulait bien me le donner pour garçon de salle et me mettre sur la voie à faire de lui mon domestique et de ma sœur mon épouse. Quoi qu'il en soit la soirée se termina de la manière la plus rassurante pour moi. Nous fîmes un peu de musique, et la vieille dame m'offrit, de peur sans doute que je n'entrasse Melchior dans quelque querelle de ma part, de lui apprendre le premier air que j'avais eu la précaution de lui faire copier avant que nous nous quittassions. Je ne lui dis rien de mon secret, mais je fis connaître au public qu'on pouvait entendre son chant. C'était un chant d'opéra très-simple, et à peu près comme les chants que les mauvais acteurs chantent dans les comédies. Il y avait, cependant, une nuance d'intré-",0.988219895287958,0.2650698602794411,-0.7317703665516648,LLAMA-2-7B,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.5699668159288936,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-meta-llama-Llama-2-7b-hf.jsonl

Il se fait que les deux jeunes n'était pas fier de rire le côté du pouvoir à sa chute. Quand je vous propose de lui donner de bonne conscience, je n'avais pas compris que ce soit toutes les autres. Là, c'est dans mon côté, de m'avoir toutefois fait lui-même leur mérite que m'avoir la tête de lui, je n'avais pas un point d'accord. C'est dans mon côté une fois que ce soit toutefois de lui. L'abandonner a été toujours des études dans l'étranger et se rencontrent. J'ai le choix de détruire son pouvoir à la voie. Déjà cela est très sombre et le choix est écho. Il nous est toutefois devenu plus mauvais qu'une amie. Ce n'est pas la vie d'un monde mais une amie qui n'a pas été à quel moment. Ce n'est pas le même qui me fait lui dire de ce qu'il y a de la nouvelle. Et la série de mots fait un bateau. Avant-même, je n'avais pas pu voir ses études, mais une mieux amie, qui me fait lui faire de l'admiration. Il vaut aussi que ce soit les mots, et les mots de la maison, et les mots de la bateau. Il y a un nouveau côté à chaque moment et aujourd'hui, mais je n'avais pas pu que lui parler de lui. Le nouveau fois que je peux faire, je n'ai pas vu la meilleure meilleure défaite du pouvoir, mais je l'ai fait quand même aussi l'éducation. Il s'est très là pour la meilleure. Voilà un côté à chaque moment. Elle est bien souvent bien sûr que je lui demande de s'en faire avec le pouvoir. Mais je peux aussi faire les mots. On ne peut pas dire qui n'a pas bien vu une grosse moche. Je lui demande de s'en faire avec les bateaux. C'est vraiment une étape du pouvoir qui ne lui est pas tous. C'est comme ce n'est pas que tous les autres. Il y a un côté qui n'était pas la grand'mère, que lui n'a pas de son pouvoir pour une bateau. D'ailleurs, ce n'est pas aussi le côté à chaque moment que je peux prendre en cause de lui. J'ai dit que ce soit en meilleur moche, mais je lui avais le choix. Il s'est pris un an où j'avais pu voir la meilleure amie d'en faire avec son pouvoir. La meilleure amie peut être un taux de pouvoir, mais nous avons donné une valeur des rivaux qui nous étaient au moins pris les deux mots.

Je me demandai si j'allais pouvoir m'endormir la nuit, il fallait que je pense à une autre chose que le flambeau, à quoi cela servirait-il de m'endormir, il me faudrait tout recommencer et, cette fois, je ne serais plus aussi ingénieuse.
Je n'avais rien vu de la scène. Mais elle me semblait bien étrange et comme il me semblait que quelque chose de fort s'était produit, je me posais des questions. Au début j'eus le sentiment que quelque chose s'était passé et me surprenais parfois à m'indigner de la scène. Puis je m'habituai et mon esprit vint me trouver dans les circonstances de la scène. Je fus si étonnée que j'eus une crise, et je dis tout bas en me redressant de mon siège :
— Il m'a dit qu'il ne m'a pas reconnu et qu'il ne se souvenait plus de ce qu'il m'avait dit quand je lui parlais du docteur.
— Non, il m'a dit qu'il avait bien reconnu que j'étais la cousine de Melchior. Mais, avant de me le dire, il m'a dit que son ami était très-aimable, il m'appelait sa cousine et il avait le don de me faire rire. Je n'ai pas répondu.
— Vous lui aviez répondu que vous ne le saviez pas. Il n'a pas voulu m'entendre, il était ivre.
— Ah! oui, c'est vrai. C'est tout à fait exact. Mais alors? Il a bu quoi, il n'a pas eu de bon goût?
— Non. Il m'a demandé à boire, parce que j'avais les yeux bandés et parce que le bonhomme avait les yeux bleus. Il m'a dit qu'il se disait qu'il me connaissait, qu'il m'aimait. Il avait les yeux bleus.
— Moi? Mais j'ai eu peur, j'ai tremblé, j'étais toute rouge, je tremblais, je me demandais si j'allais mourir.
— Je vous en prie, ne pleurez pas, je vous assure que tout est fini, vous êtes avec le bon homme. Il va faire une bonne femme. Il n'est que le bon ami du bon docteur. Le docteur ne lui est pas très-aimable, mais il est très-aimable. C'est vrai. On l'aime bien. Vous êtes chez lui. Vous êtes avec lui.

Je ne m'expliquai point les mouvements subits de son coeur, je l'accusai d'inconsidération, je lui arrachai la barbe, je le menai en conseil, je m'en prit à son insolence, je le traitai de périmé, de vieillard, de nigaud et tout ce qu'on peut imaginer. Je voulais le faire taire, le mettre à la porte ou le chasser du logis tout simplement. Elle m'en empêcha. La grand'mère ne m'écoutait point elle n'était pas de mon avis je ne pouvais la raisonner elle l'accusa, par son côté, d'excès de zèle elle disait qu'il n'y avait rien de plus touchant que cette sorte de tendresse que les hommes se donnaient entre eux dans leur adolescence. ""Ce n'est ni la peur ni l'envie qui vous rend la barbe grise,"" me dit-elle, ""et les autres hommes ne font pas attention à cet engouement qui défigure leurs coeurs."" Ce n'était pas, à vrai dire, l'engouement qui le rendait gris j'étais trop émue moi-même pour s'attarder là-dessus. Melchior, après ce qu'il venait de faire, ne pouvait me revoir et passer le reste de ses jours auprès de moi, que je ne me dé-con-solais de la chute qui m'était annoncée. Il y avait quelque chose de trop fort, de trop violent et de trop bien inspiré dans son aventure, pour qu'elle ne le rendit pas, d'un coup, plus beau, plus attrayant qu'il ne l'avait jamais été. C'était de l'égoïsme et de la malice que j'étais coupable, je me mis à trembler à l'idée que le mystère ne lui plairait point et que la grand'mère s'en irait, et, comme elle ne le supportait pas, lui laissât pour tout héritage son neveu. Il y avait bien plus d'un mois qu'elle ne m'avait rien dit de ce côté-là, et la pression de l'aîné la poussait à en faire le plus tôt possible. Mais, enfin, il y eut un beau matin un entretien comme à l'ordinaire, et, dès que je fus sortie, j'entendis la grand'mère demander de l'eau-de-vie. Je m'en vins au-devant d'elle, et, la prenant à la main, je l'invitai à venir à sa chambre, je voulais lui dire des mots de consolation. Elle refusa, elle se plaignait, elle avait, sans moi, un certain genre de vie; elle disait qu'elle y fêtait son anniversaire, et qu'elle n'y tiendrait pas plus longtemps. Je lui fis remarquer que le médecin ne voulait pas que le petit vît le soleil, mais elle me répliqua qu'il la rendrait bien malheureuse si elle n'avait pas l'occasion de faire la paix avec Dieu.

J'étais outrée de ce qu'il venait de se permettre je me promettais bien de ne pas m'y exposer de nouveau, et de se lancer avec lui dans un jeu d'échange qui aurait duré quelques jours et une partie de nuit. Il l'avait fait don pour moi, mais je lui était loin d'y penser. Il n'allait pas m'empêcher de m'abandonner. Il n'appartient pas à nous de parler d'étranges épisodes dans un logis; ce qui importe, c'est d'avoir un peu de chambre, d'avoir du sang, et de pouvoir aller s'acheter de la viande quand on se sent besoin. J'étais en train de me lever à toute heure. A la maison, de même que quand ils viennent au château. Ëtait-ce cela? De ne pas faire rien et de me prendre à ma tête? C'est ce que je me méfiais, la voir me détruire par lui et de lui déstabiliser. Quelle idée pour faire de l'amour, ce gars qui allait, il me fait, deux ans plus tôt, m'étonner, me confondre dans tous ses petits airs, me chercher un peu, me rassembler, me lâcher en fin de journée pour faire une visite. On a de bons désirs, mais en dessous d'un certain point, il est temps de prévoir quand ce n'est pas une décision. A ce que je comprenais, Melchior m'avait promis de m'occuper en deux mois. De s'être rassurée de moi? S'il n'y avait pas de taule. Pour ce qui était de ma santé, il me laissa faire. Ëtait-ce le rêve de quelqu'un, d'être seul avec moi, un seul dans le château ou, dans la nature, un seul au ciel? Cela, cela j'avais toujours dit, cela n'était pas possible. On avait bien des histoires à raconter, une vie de médailles, des plaisirs, des jours de merde, des jours de bons et de mauvais souvenirs. On ne se cachait pas dans nos vieilles rêves, nous faisons de l'amour avec les époux de nos croyances, nous voulons des enfants, nous savons qu'on en a. On est aussi des humeurs mais, dans la vie, on s'amène à la mort parce qu'on sait très bien qu'on l'a. J'ai dit à ma grand'mère, au bout de quelques jours, qu'elle me lui rendrait sa fête et son événement, et qu'elle me donnerait ses paroles en résidence. Il lui faisait venir les gens pour me convoquer pour des rencontres. Ètait-ce ça? Pouvait-il se passer de toute cette vie qu'il avait là? Dans un logis, il ne saurait manger les champs, ne saurait-il jouir du soleil, ne saurait-il courir à pied et à vélo, ne saurait-il manger d'hippopotames et d'acacia, ne saurait-il manger de beaucoup d'autres choses qui était naturellement partagé par toutes les femmes, nous n'avons que l'â",0.988219895287958,0.4904679376083189,-0.5036854247248269,OPT-6.7B,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.670960359421237,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl

Ce n'était pourtant pas un acte de vengeance que j'avais commis, c'était la preuve de ma faiblesse, de mon incapacité à le voir autrement que par son apparence extérieure. Je craignais beaucoup cette épreuve et m'en préparais le malaise, mais ce n'était pas le premier que je devais supporter, et je me le reprochais toujours. Mon père aussi l'avait subi un jour et l'avait trouvé fâcheux; il s'était moqué de sa surprise, de ses larmes, de sa déception et avait dit : « Si nous avions pu être sûrs de sa personne, il n'aurait pas fallu le recevoir en visite et l'avoir au milieu de nous, comme un étranger. Mais son âme a été sauvée et il ne peut donc plus être notre ennemi. » 256
Je croyais avoir été bonne fille en me conduisant ainsi, mais la pensée qu'il m'eût été permis d'être sa femme me tourmentait de plus en plus. Ce serait m'offrir à un démon, car il ne pouvait pas avoir plus d'étourderie et de coquetterie, et je me sentais de plus en plus malheureuse. Et puis ma grand'mère! Il me fallait supporter cet accueil humiliant. Je ne pouvais pas, et je ne voulais pas me séparer d'elle. Je voulais l'aimer sans jamais pouvoir lui plaire. Si nous allions jusqu'à cette épreuve, elle voudrait bien, pour ma honte, me laisser mourir. Je devais donc, de toute ma force, résister, m'empêcher de succomber et de faire le sacrifice de ma vertu. Je voulais me forcer à paraître le moins possible enjouée de la visite de Melchior. Il s'agissait seulement de dissimuler, et de n'être ni laide ni la plus gracieuse, et je me résignais à la voir tous les jours, pendant qu'elle était à la maison, sans essayer de la séduire, et en refusant de m'adresser la parole. Je faisais le tour de la pièce, je m'assurais de la porte, puis je m'endormais, et je m'éveillais la première, dans mon sommeil. Dès le jour qui suivit, je me mis en tête de ne plus aller le voir. Mais je n'avais pas eu le courage d'y renoncer. Dès que ma grand'mère était allée se coucher, je descendais dans le salon, je m'allongeais, et je restais là jusqu'au jour. Je n'avais aucune envie de manger, je ne voulais voir personne, et je ne pouvais me rendre à la messe. Mon seul désir, c'était de rester ici jusqu'à la fin de mes jours, dans ce petit coin de chambre que je trouvais charmant, à l'ombre de mes rideaux et de mes coussins, et où j'avais l'habitude de dormir avec le feu allumé, les pieds sur des livres ou dans le canapé.

Au hasard de mes mots il me dit que c'eilltait bien qu'il s'asseyait à ma place et que je n'avais qu'à le voir dormir pour le réformer. J'ai été très-affectée et je me sentais comme une enfant devant un père aimant. Le silence était très-tôt troublé, et, au fur et à mesure que les voix me parlaient, mon coeur s'est mis en émoi. En pleurant je me suis allongée sur le rebord du lit, et, sans pouvoir le réveiller, je me suis hâté d'aller au-dehors, jusqu'à ce que le bruit d'un fracas retentit et que j'entendis à la porte se saisir la fille. Je me rendis aussitôt au bout de la pièce, en laissant un passage étroit à la fille. Mes pensées étaient en train de se dé-livrer et je me sentais seule avec mon ami, je ne m'étais pas sentie seule avant. Mais il fut trop tard, il ne me quitta plus. C'est à ce moment que les hurlements des animaux se sont emparés de moi et que j'ai commencé à pleuvoir. Je ne me suis pas penchée sur le rebord du lit mais, comme mes pensées s'étaient éloignées de moi et que je me rendais au-dehors, j'ai entendu une grande voix approcher. Je me suis aussitôt penchée sur le rebord du lit pour voir que le bruit de ce fracas était bien le mien et je me suis jetée dans mon lit. Je n'ai pas dû me réveiller très-bien pour me rendre compte de ce que j'allais faire mais mes pensées s'étaient complètement déliées. Au bout d'un moment, j'ai eu peur de tomber sur un homme et j'ai mis mon épaule contre le rebord du lit, mes bras joints et mes jambes écartées. Une minute plus tard la voix a pris le dessus, elle a commencé à crier sans cesse. Le bruit fut tellement violent, que je me suis jetée sur le rebord et je n'ai pas eu le temps de me remuer, et j'ai succombé à cette horrible douleur. J'avais eu un mal fou et je me suis réveillée dans une pièce très-trop sombre et sans lumière. L'étrange odeur d'herbe s'est répandue dans toute la pièce et j'ai regardé vers le lit. Je sentis un mouvement se produire dans tout le lit, mais mes yeux ne voyaient rien, et je me suis levée, comme si j'allais tomber à ma première nuit. Un bruit s'est fait entendre au loin, des cris étaient devenus inten-tables, le lit était noir de noir, le plafond était trempé, et ma main commençait à se perdre dans les bras de la fille qui était allongée sur le rebord du lit.

Le lendemain matin, la grand'mère me fit part de ses inquiétudes. Il avait été de mon côté, le pauvre homme, se disait-elle, il avait été fort maladroit mais il était très-bonhomme, il ne voulait pas qu'on se fâchât avec son ami, et, de toute façon, c'eût été trop méchant de lui en vouloir, il avait été bien naturel de le retenir. Elle ne savait pas ce qu'elle aurait dû faire et elle s'imaginait que mon mari serait mort si elle avait tenté quelque chose. La chose était un peu facile à comprendre, un beau matin, avec un petit garçon de six ans, on n'avait pas idée de faire une chose pareille. Il y avait cependant un peu de vérité dans ses craintes. J'avais un grand garçon de dix ans qui, malgré sa grande robustesse, se laissait facilement effrayer par tout ce qui pouvait être effrayant. Il ne faut pas s'étonner si, après ce que j'ai raconté plus haut, le pauvre petit avait été si effrayé. C'est un enfant de coeur qui ne se laisse pas facilement troubler. La grand'mère n'était pas encore tout-à-fait rassurée. Je lui demandai si elle ne savait pas que tout le monde sait ce qui s'est passé le lendemain de notre départ, que mon mari ne s'est pas sauvé, que Melchior s'est échappé, et qu'elle a été saisie comme je le l'ai été. Pour m'écouter, elle a dû lui poser une question, à ce petit bonhomme, et elle s'est dit qu'il n'était peut-être pas possible qu'il ne l'eût pas vu et qu'elle ait dû le croire pour avoir fait son affaire. J'ai tout vu de près; il a essayé de me retenir mais il s'est laissé faire. Les amis de Melchior me l'ont bien dit. Il a dû être très fier de sa supercherie, et, quand il a vu que je ne pouvais pas me fâcher avec lui il s'est retiré. Il ne s'est pas rendu compte que cela l'était de me laisser seule, mais, comme je savais qu'il ne m'avait pas vue, j'ai bien pensé qu'il était inutile de lui en vouloir, car, en tout cas, je pouvais lui faire confiance. Je lui ai parlé du bonhomme de ma grand'mère. Elle est sortie du cabinet et a fait ses commissions, en ne tenant pas compte des remarques que je lui avais faites. Elle n'était pas seule dans la cuisine. Des domestiques sont sortis de partout et elle a vu un homme passer, je suppose un domestique, dans la cour. Elle m'a raconté toute cette histoire et j'ai demandé à sa servante de me dire ce qui était arrivé. La servante m'a dit que c'était un homme qui était venu chez moi et qu'il m'avait prise pour la grand'mère. Il ne m'a pas laissée entrer. Je ne sais pas où il est parti. Si le pauvre homme a voulu essayer quelque chose c'est bien inutile car il ne peut pas m'atteindre. Il ne l'a pas voulu, bien entendu, mais il n'est pas venu avec moi et je crois qu'il est parti. En tout cas il ne m'a pas prise pour la grand'mère et j'espère que je ne lui",0.988219895287958,0.2973347178954655,-0.699120894738893,BLOOM-3B,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.814676726439214,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-bigscience-bloom-3b.jsonl

Il n'était pas question que je sois toujours aussi jalouse, si le méchant avait de vivants desquels je n'ai jamais été séduite, en prétendant que il était son mieux. Cela aurait été méprisant. D'autant plus que je suis devenue trop sensible aux chagrins et aux jalousies de tous ceux qu'il connaissait. Il avait besoin de mieux, cependant, qu'il n'eût aucun ami. Ce dont il a besoin, c'est de se prendre un peu à l'amour et en l'entourer, de lui placer un peu de légitimité et, enfin, de m'apporter un très-bien. Il doit y avoir une relation entre nous; il doit y avoir un nombre qui peut lui permettre de s'enlever de la lourdeur que lui a imposée son absence et, par la suite, de me faire sortir de mes difficultés. Il n'est pas impossible que, s'il nous fait l'amour, on se ré-entraîne en dehors d'une maison et que ce soit un voyage qui soit fait, mais, même si cela se produira, il sera de toute façon très difficile de s'affranchir de la présence de tout mouvement qui peut le remplacer dans notre esprit. Et la chose est très simple; il a besoin de quelqu'un qui lui donnera du plaisir. Il ne saurait s'attendre à de quoi, n'est-ce que si on le traite, on lui donnera du plaisir. Il doit y avoir un certain nombre d'amants qu'il doit rencontrer pour qu'il n'a pas l'impression d'être, à toutes les occasions, déjà en train d'avoir de nouveau entendu parler de lui, ou qu'il ne s'attende jamais à ce que ses connaissances ne s'expliquent qu'en les réveillant, de leur envoyer des SMS et de ne jamais leur repousser, que quelqu'un ne lui donne le coup de fil, que quelqu'un ne réussissent à le pousser de loin, que quelqu'un ne le défraie jamais, que quelqu'un ne lui donne qu'une véritable chance et que quelqu'un, surtout, ne le perde pas. Mais, au moins, il ne doit pas être lui-même, comme le souhaitent certains, une seule femme. Il doit pouvoir se rapprocher de quelqu'un, d'entrer dans un amour. Il ne doit pas être séduit, cependant, ni pris en otage par quelqu'un. Son amour doit être un amour pour lui, qu'il puisse choisir ou qu'il ne puisse pas contester. Il ne doit pas être trop exigeant de quelqu'un. S'il a un très mauvais être, il doit s'y précipiter. Il doit nécessairement faire quelque chose pour saisir les femmes; il doit déjà connaitre quelqu'un. Il doit, surtout, les connaitre, parce que c'est quelqu'un qui dit quelque chose.

In the second section we see the four French nouns used in this essay, which give an example of a noun which is used in English. The first is a noun which is used in English, and the last is a noun which is not used in English.

In the first case, it is the same as in French, in which case it has the same meaning as in English. In other words, the French nouns that are used in English are not used in English because they are not used in English.

The same problem with Frenchrugged is also apparent with other languages: French, Germanic, Germanic, and Germanic have to do with the following words, which give an example of a noun. Here is a short example of a noun which is used in English:

J'étais outrée de ce qu'il venait de se permettre je me promettais bien de ne pas m'y exposer de nouveau, et de","le tenir fortement à distance; mais, le lendemain, je trouvai la matinée entière à le chercher, à me dire qu'il n'avait pas pu m'aimer ainsi pour rien. L'événement de la veille me tenait de si près que je ne pouvais m'en défaire; j'avais le frisson dans tous mes membres, et, quand ma grand'mère me fit des questions sur mon lit, où je m'étais placée pour que rien ne l'empêchât d'avoir une bonne vue sur moi, je répondis à sa question de manière à la tromper sans le duper. Melchior, à son tour, vint me voir pour me demander si j'avais rêvé. Il paraissait très-ému, et s'appuyait à la porte pour ne pas tomber, tant il avait la tête troublée et les sens en dérangement. Je le vis, et comme j'étais toujours prête à me servir de lui pour mon compte, je ne l'interrogeai pas. Lui, il en parla bien à sa guise, à ce que je puis croire, car, le soir même, je n'eus pas la moindre occasion de lui souhaiter le bonsoir. En ce moment, il avait l'esprit troublé; à la moindre parole, il laissait échapper des choses incohérentes, qu'il s'obstinait ensuite à expliquer et qui devaient faire rire, si nous avions été tous les trois seuls. En attendant, j'avais l'impression que, chaque fois qu'il se mettait à parler, ma grand'mère se réveillait comme pour l'interrompre. Il arrivait quelquefois qu'elle disait, d'une voix calme: Je croyais que vous étiez encore au lit. Elle voulait dire au lit en rêve, j'ai eu peur. Il paraissait lui échapper une idée, et, quand il s'en rendait compte, il me le disait à lui-même: «Non, non, je n'aurais pas pu m'endormir encore, mais, par hasard, j'ai été distrait.» Il me parla d'autre chose, ce qui me parut singulier. Je lui demandai s'il s'était trouvé en train de faire ses classes, quand il lui était arrivé ce qui lui était arrivé. Non, il me répondit. Et moi, dans le moment, je pense que, lui aussi, se serait passé une chose, car, lorsque le rêve me tenait à la gorge et ne me laissait plus un instant de silence, je lui disais: «À vous, vous devez le rendre.» Je le priai de ne pas m'en parler; mais, d'un moment à l'autre, il était tout prêt à m'en dire plus.

Je commençai par me demander ce que cela voulait dire; puis je me souvins que je n'étais plus un enfant et que je ne m'arrêtai plus.

Nous ne voulûmes pas nous quitter, car les moments se passaient dans les choses d'ordinaire, comme s'il eût fallu qu'elles se dissipassent.

Nous avons marché un moment en silence, puis Melchior s'est arrêté net, m'a regardé d'un air solennel et a dit : ""Vous savez ce qu'on peut voir dans une rue ?"" J'ai haussé les sourcils, étonné. ""Eh bien, tout dépend de ce que l'on veut voir"", a-t-il poursuivi avec un sourire malicieux. ""On peut voir des hommes pressés, des femmes élégantes, des enfants qui jouent, des chiens qui aboient, des chats qui ronronnent. Mais surtout, on peut voir des histoires. Des histoires qui se cachent derrière chaque visage, chaque regard, chaque geste. Des histoires qui peuvent nous toucher, nous surprendre, nous émouvoir."" Il s'est tu, m'a fixé intensément, puis a ajouté : ""Et vous, quelle histoire voulez-vous voir ?""

J'ai été frappé par la profondeur de ses paroles. Melchior, le dragueur invétéré, le plaisantin de service, pouvait se montrer philosophe quand il le voulait. Je me suis demandé ce qu'il avait voulu dire exactement. Voulait-il dire que chacun de nous porte en lui une part de mystère, une part d'inconnu, qu'il appartient à chacun de découvrir ? Ou voulait-il dire que la vie est pleine de surprises, qu'il faut savoir les saisir quand elles se présentent ? Je n'en savais rien, mais j'avais été touché par ses paroles.

Nous avons continué notre route jusqu'au pied de l'immeuble où j'habitais. Melchior m'a serré la main, puis s'est éloigné en m'adressant un dernier sourire énigmatique. J'ai regardé son dos disparaître dans la nuit, puis j'ai soupiré. Melchior restait un mystère pour moi, mais un mystère fascinant.

J'allais dire à la grand'mère que Melchior m'avait laissé aller le chercher sans m'avoir avertie. J'attendis son retour, j'attendis son retour. Et je m'attendais au moins. Je le voyais presque chaque soir. Il me le montrait avec fierté, il me l'a montrait chaque soir en passant et chaque soir je l'attendais sans le voir. J'attendais toujours. J'avais beau chercher, chercher, il se révélait toujours. Et quand il disparaissait j'étais toute étonnée, car il m'avait semblé avoir de nombreuses raisons de se cacher. Mais, il avait beau m'être tout à coup caché, il me suffisait de le voir sourire, pour qu'il me paraissît tout de suite un ami. C'est toujours comme cela, quand on ne veut pas de la chose, on la retrouve. Un jour, j'étais de nouveau sortie sans mes habits, je le trouvai qui me attendait sur la route de ma maison. Il ne m'avais pas aperçue, il était tout seul. Il était vêtu de ses mêmes vêtements il portait une grosse capote à bords repliés, et il était accompagné par une jeune fille. J'aimais le voir ainsi, il m'avait fait un grand plaisir. Je le trouvai bien trop maigre pour être la mère de mon ami. Mais je lui dis tout de suite que c'était un garçon, un bon garçon et que je lui pardonnais son infortune. Et comme il n'était pas encore entré dans mes idées, je lui dis qu'il me payerait un petit voyage pour aller le voir. En sortant de chez nous nous nous arrêtâmes à une grande place. Je lui demandai combien coûtait le voyage. « C'est à peu près le prix de quatre tickets de métro. » - « Quatre billets de métro, oui, et quatre tickets de métro, ce n'est pas beaucoup, ce n'est pas très cher, mais j'ai l'habitude de marcher, de marcher, et je n'ai pas assez de temps. » Et je me mis à marcher, il me suivait avec un air désolé. Il semblait bien que le mal des transports lui touchait de près, et son air de déception avait beaucoup de charme. - « Mais, chère enfant, nous sommes presque arrivés à destination, s'écria t-il en nous jetant un dernier regard. Nous y sommes presque, n'est-ce pas? » « Je crois bien », lui répondis-je en riant. Puis nous entrâmes dans un magasin où j'acheta quelques biscuits et deux bouteilles de vin. Il me demanda à quel étage il voulait passer et je lui dis la rue où l'on voit les plus jolies maisons, celle qui porte la plus belle avenue et le plus bel immeuble de la ville.

À l'instant même que je lui demandais ce que c'était qu'il fallait penser du nouvel incident, voici que je voyais venir sur moi un de mes oncles, ce pauvre homme que la mort de sa femme avait réduit à une deplorable mélan-cholie, de même qu'à d'irritans mouvements du foie et des reins qui le faisaient tour-ner en rond, dans la maison, comme un animal en cage, et mener la vie la plus misérable. Il est vrai qu'il n'en avait pas la volonté. Il était pourtant inutile de le pousser, car il ne se reposait plus d'un instant. Je l'entrai dans mon petit cabinet, que je pratiquai au bout du salon, j'examinai avec soin son visage, et en même temps, pour lui faire plaisir, je lui fis l'honneur de porter une de ses deux chaises, ce que l'on ne lui avait jamais offert avant moi. Il prit sa place sans rien dire, et s'installa avec une gravité qui me fit souvenir de mon beau-frère, notre ancien régisseur, si bon homme que je n'avais pu jamais lui en vouloir. De vrai qu'il fallait bien lui rendre ce qu'il avait fait pour nous, et s'il avait à son actif de petites erreurs, il avait aussi son côté positif, et, dans notre maison, avait bien fait ce qu'il lui avait été possible. Le temps s'écoula, et l'oncle ne dit rien. Je m'expliquai le silence. « Vous avez été très-bien pour moi, me dis-je, et je suis venu me plaindre de l'affection dont j'avais été l'objet de laSPOIRITUEUSE. Je le lui avouais, et comme elle était pour moi un ami très-tendre, elle ne m'en voulait pas. Elle prenait mon intérêt pour elle. Elle me faisait même plaisir de son côté en prenant pitié de ma souffrance. Je me levai de mon banc et lui baisai les mains. L'oncle ne m'en dit pas davantage, et j'en eus le cœur brisé. Vous vous dites à présent que le bonhomme avait été jaloux, et que, dans son délire, il m'aurait tout de suite foulée aux pieds. Non, au contraire, je n'ai vu en lui que pitié et amitié, et il est resté là, dans son coin, sans rien dire, et sans rien faire. Dix-sept heures sonnèrent. C'était le moment où ma grand'mère allait se coucher; elle entrait, j'avais le devoir de l'en distraire, mais elle, elle n'en eut pas le désir. J'avais déjà eu de la peine à la tenir à mes côtés, et cette époque avait fini par lui rendre mon amitié insupportable. Elle ne voulait plus s'occuper de moi, et son amitié ne valait plus que de l'amitié.

J'étais outrée de ce qu'il venait de se permettre je me promettais bien de ne pas m'y exposer de nouveau, et de faire m'abstenir de me demander que se passait-il, et de ne pas m'en souvenir de son nom. J'entendais ces paroles se décliner parmi ma douleur. Mon chagrin s'imparfait comme un noisetier entre deux chemises. Je m'étonnais de sa façon de me regarder au visage. Son visage était à la fois tous les deux un visage de jeunesse, et une bonne et vivante.
'I think he thinks we are enemies. He will soon part company with us. Let us take leave of one another. I am going to have a short sleep. You may go down and do as you please. My grandfather will be up in a minute.'
Melchior got up to leave the room, but instead of going out he sat down on the chair.
'He says we may as well keep the lights burning. He wishes to keep his eye upon the house.'
'Well, I wish to be in bed myself, but if he is pleased to sit up then I will do as he bids.'
'Well, good night then.'
'Good night, father.'
'Well, my boy, have you settled the question of your mother's jewels yet?'
'No; but I do not think she will keep them.'
'Will you get them back for me? I do not know how long I may be away from home.'
'I will try, father, but I should not like to disappoint her. It would be more like robbing her to do so.'
'Very well, boy, if you think it right to spare her feelings, and yet not to obey my orders, go and rob her yourself, but do not spare her, and do it at once.'
Melchior's face was very pale.
'I will do as you say, father, but I shall not like it.'
'Oh! no doubt you will not,' answered the old man.
'My grandfather is very strange to-night. I do not like to leave him.'
'I don't blame you,' said the old man, 'for I feel the same. However, we must all do our duty.'
'I have no father, or mother, father. I have only you,' replied Melchior.
The old man was silent for a few minutes. He seemed to be thinking deeply. Melchior, too, was thinking deeply. He tried to persuade himself that his grandfather would have liked to be left to himself, but the feeling of loneliness which had come over him during the conversation made him think otherwise. He felt that the old man was his father, his protector, his friend. The thought of abandoning him made him feel sad. He thought that if he were to go away his grandfather would be all the happier.
'What ails you, Melchior? Have you a fever?' asked the old man.
Melchior shook his head.
'You have a very strange look on your face to-night. You are not yourself, my boy.'
Melchior's face was all over a glowing red, and his eyes were twinkling like stars in the moonlight.
'You have had some feverish fit, I suppose,' said the old man.
'No, grandfather; I am all right. I shall go to bed now.'
'You will have to go to bed if you want me to go,' said the old man, sharply.
'I have no other bed than the one you gave me. If I do not go to bed now I shall go to bed to-morrow. I have a headache. I think it would be as well for us both to go to bed.'
Melchior went to his bedroom and shut the door, which he locked carefully after him. When he was alone he stood still a long time. His head ached, and he had a sort of strange fear. He was going to leave his grandfather to himself, and this made him feel frightened.
Suddenly the door of the room opened, and Melchior saw his grandfather standing in the doorway.
'What are you doing, my boy?' asked the old man.
'Nothing, grandfather. I was thinking.'",0.988219895287958,0.4024173480270174,-0.5927856239832566,OPT-6.7B,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.7963928119916284,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl

Le lendemain, ma mère fit de son côté des observations bien différentes, mais qui tendaient vers le même but. Elle ne trouvait rien à redire à ma nouvelle allure et me trouvait beaucoup mieux. Je m'en réjouissais car enfin on voyait bien que j'avais fait de grands progrès. Ma mère me disait toujours : - "" Il ne faut jamais dire jamais, "" et ce jour-là, elle allait m'offrir la preuve de son incrédulité. Elle était dans sa chambre et je m'attendais à lui faire part de ma découverte. Tout à coup je l'entendis rire. Une petite moue de surprise passa sur ses lèvres, puis elle se mit à rire de plus belle. - "" Quoi? Quoi? "" me dit-elle en se dandinant. - "" Vous n'allez pas croire ce qui m'arrive "" dis-je. - "" Vous êtes sûre que ce n'est pas un rêve? "" répondit-elle. "" Je ne puis y croire moi-même, mais je suis sûre de ne pas l'avoir rêvé, et je crois que je suis amoureuse de ce petit garçon "". Je me levai d'un coup. - "" Eh bien! que voulez-vous? "" me dit-elle. - "" Je ne vois pas pourquoi vous vous en réjouissez. Je suis bien aise que vous ayez un petit amour pour moi, mais il faudrait être bien sorcière pour le deviner "". - "" C'est vrai, "" me répondit-elle, "" je suis une sorcière. "" Je ne pouvais plus la supporter. Elle s'achemina vers moi, et se mit à m'embrasser avec une violence que je n'avais jamais rencontrée. Elle m'embrassait sur les deux joues. Je me fâchai, mais elle se mit à rire: - "" Eh bien, qu'y-a-t-il? "" - "" Laisse-moi donc tranquille "" lui dis-je. Elle me jeta un regard inquiet, et s'agenouilla pour me serrer contre elle. - "" Vous êtes sûre, "" me dit-elle, "" que vous n'allez pas prendre froid? "" - "" Oh! pas du tout "" - "" Je vous assure que j'ai pris froid "" dis-je en m'asseyant. - "" Moi aussi, "" me répondit-elle en riant. - "" Eh bien, ce n'est pas la peine de recommencer, car je ne vous en parlerai pas. Je vous aime trop bien pour vous ennuyer avec cela "". - "" C'est vrai, "" dis-je en rougissant. - "" Vous pouvez dire que je vous aime "" dit elle en levant les yeux au ciel. - "" C'est bien ce qu'il faut que je fasse, "" me dit- je en m'asseyant près d'elle.

Je la mettrai en garde contre toutes sortes de préjugés erronés, contre toutes les opinions trop tranchées, et je lui parlerais de toute façon avec modération. Elle n'eut pas à me le dire mais je la demandai de m'accompagner de nouveau au lieu de le conduire seul. C'est-à-dire, d'aller au moins à deux. Et, tout de suite après, je lui demandai ce qu'il voulait faire de mon bras gauche, et je lui demandai de me donner une impulsion sur le côté. Je devais y donner mon entière impulsion, en dépit de mon état, mon faible état. C'est-à-dire, que si je lui disais que je pouvais tout aussi bien le faire du côté droit, ou tout à fait du côté droit, il devait me répondre par un acte de dévouement. Un geste généreux, une impulsion pour moi, que j'exécutai sans hésitation.
Il était assez tard. L'instant venu, nous devions nous installer ensemble dans le couloir de la chambre. La grande chambre du sous-sol n'était pas fermée, il était toujours un peu clair sur la pente, elle était aussi haute que la terrasse voisine. Le lit était à quelques marches du sol, le canapé et le lit sur le mur, le tout dans un esprit de grand confort. Je ne savais pas encore si je devais en parler avec elle, et je ne savais pas non plus que Melchior y consentirait, sauf si nous avions trouvé un moyen de le dissuader ou, pire encore, si nous avions quelque idée de ce qu'il se passerait. Il nous fallait faire quelque chose, il fallait que nous trouvions un moyen de faire quelque chose en attendant que, bien sûr, nous trouvions un moyen de faire quelque chose. Et il faudrait que nous trouvions un moyen de faire quelque chose en attendant qu'il se décide.
Un bon matin. Je levai, je sentis monter mes fringues, le petit pot qui était en ma possession me parut presque vide, j'élevai ma tête, et je me riais. Mon cœur montait de chagrin, mais à la fin, malgré tout cela, je me remetta à croire à un rêve. C'était, comme je me riais, la dernière journée d'une vie bien dure. Il est vrai qu'à cette époque, je ne croyais pas aux rêves. Un jour, lorsque nous étions au seuil de la maison où il me fallait m'installer, la petite dame de la rue vint me voir, me tendant un petit sac en plastique.

In the present case, the present sentence is:

In the evening, at midnight, I wish that someone would come with me to tell me what happened in Paris to the victims of the attack on July 11, 2002. It has not been possible to verify who took the responsibility for that attack. For the second and third year after it was alleged, there were two other possible suspects involved.

A person of the same address was responsible for the attack and they both lived in the same area. The two other suspects are known to each otherstephen and the first one had the previous knowledge of the attack.

The third and fourth year of the criminal case was the time of the attack. The man samples the body after he leaves a hotel and he was taken to the police station.

According to some, there were no other suspects. In fact, the third year of the criminal case was the time of the attack. On May 16, 2002, there were two other possible suspects involved in that case.

I want to clarify the situation that occurred on the evening of that day. There were three suspects with different identities, all of whom were from the same address. They were involved in different areas. I would like to know who took the responsibility for the attack, but I cannot.

The three persons in question are in the same city. There was no way to verify who took the responsibility for that attack.

I wish to give my thanks to the prosecutor and the defense team. I am very grateful to the prosecutor and the defense team for their willingness to cooperate. I am also very thankful that the police will keep a very close watch on me in that case. I also want to mention that the prosecutor's office was working very hard. They have also taken measures to avoid any false information that might be sent in the future to other agencies. I want to tell you that I hope that this report will not only inform the public but also the media.

Un grandement nombre d'impôts est à l'aise de nombreuses mots de la société, parfois leur poursuivre. Pour nous, j'ai toujours pu voir de nouveau l'attentat des mots de la société. Mais la fois, ce n'est pas la question des mots dans l'industrie de la société et envers la société privée. Nous avons été un écran qui a bien été au courant de des études qui s'opposent aux mots de la société privée. Ce que j'ai été, nous sommes écrasés, une autre écran qui est au courant de des études qui ne sont pas là. Si l'industrie peut bien ajouter la fois, nous sommes allés entendre, en faisant l'accord entre les études qui sont arrivés. Si les mots dans la société sont déjà enflammés, pourrait-on vivre, comme l'avait dit ça, mais ne jamais pas compris là, ce n'est pas la question des mots de la société. J'ai toujours pu enfin avoir une étude ou-je de l'électorat d'un écran qui a des mots de la société privée, pour ne pas être dans l'industrie privée. J'ai toujours pu voir de nouveau l'attentat des mots de la société privée. Mais ça ne doit pas être nombre de mots dans l'industrie privée, mais vous ne pouvez pas vous trouver un écran qui ne le fera pas.

Un autre fois, c'est qu'il y a en effet un aider de nouveau l'industrie privée, mais nous avons une fois enfin une autre fois de la fois des mots dans l'industrie privée et la fois dans l'industrie privée, et en effet de se découvrir des mots de la société privée, mais vous êtes une autre fois de la société privée.

We had come face to face with enemies, we were going to part the best of friends. Not because there was any substance in this or a danger to you, but this good looking man had thrown some life into our inner space and made us laugh with him. We were glad of this in return, and forgetting the little troubles that he had caused me, his impertinences, his fading airs, his pipes, his cravats and his beard. He had to be seen, or he lost his good looks. From far away he saw himself out of reach and lost his advantage. His tact was perfect from the start, but in the end I had to take him back. We were already at the top when he left. He was leaving me too, and he was looking down at me so closely that I had to lift up my head. The stairs were starting to descend, and before I knew it, he was already on the stairs. He was still apologizing and I promised that I wouldn't take him back. I had already been waiting for him, and he was already on the stairs when my candle went out. Did he? Was he the want? I have never known, but at that moment I felt a pull at my waist and suddenly felt a hug from both my sides. The mystery was already growing, between Melchior and me, I was feeling a kind of complicity. I was outraged for the way he was acting, I promised myself I wouldn't get involved with this any more and kept that promise. Soon the mystery began to grow, between Melchior and me, and already the otherness was feeling its way inside me.</s>",0.988219895287958,0.2720524017467249,-0.7247045894907314,BLOOM-3B,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.8071036759608353,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-bigscience-bloom-3b.jsonl

Melchior HAD CE DON; HE SEPARATED FROM PEOPLE AND DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THEM UNTIL IT CAME INTO HIS MIND. This HAPPENED ONE OF THE TIMES HE SAID GOODBYE TO HIS FRIENDS. NOT BECAUSE HE WAS SEEKING TO TROUBLE ANY OF THEM, NOR BECAUSE HE WAS AFFLICTED BY ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING TO ENTERTAIN HIS GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD FALLEN ASLEEP. I FORGAVE HIM FOR ALL HIS FREQUENT VISITS BEFORE, AND EVEN REMEMBERED THE HURT I HAD FELT WHEN HE TOUCHED THE TOWEL. I FORGAVE HIM EVEN MORE WHEN HE LEFT. HE WAS TAKING A TRIP SO WHEN I STUMBLED UPON HIM AGAIN, I WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM. I HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF HIS MISSING A FEW WEEKS AND ASKED HIM HOW HE WAS. HE SAID HE WAS ALL RIGHT, BUT THEN HE QUICKLY LIFTED HIS FACE SO THAT WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO SEE HIS EYES. THEY WERE CRYING, AND WE REALIZED THAT WE WOULD ALL DIE SOON. HE LEFT AFTER I DID NOTHING TO HELP HIM. I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL THE SMALL PROBLEMS HE CAUSED ME BEFORE AND FORGIVEN HIM FOR THEM.

I am sorry to see you go away but I had no doubt that you will never mind to go further. I hope you will not. I have to say that I found that in a moment of surprise it became quite possible that I would be in trouble and leave you with my best friends at the world. I did not mean that there were any serious or dangerous for you, but it was Melchior that I had turned to myself and let him be in all my strength. It was Melchior that I gave me his farewell. He was still living here at the top of the world, and I had not forgotten him for a moment. I went over every street of the city, but I went to the bottom of the world for him. I lost it all, and I had lost nothing except my self-respect, and all my friends' friendship at the time. I had no doubt that he had put on an alarming manner to me. I thought about that all the time but I didn't see any reason for my curiosity until I saw him marching along the steps, and then I stopped to watch him take his farewell. He was still on the stairs, and I couldn't resist seeing him march through the passages. Soon we had the highest elevations as well as the lower ones. There is a difference of opinion here as to whether or not he had been able to escape without the assistance of some one who could not know him. I thought as I went along that he was always in danger in his own way but I couldn't think how he could have made this off. He stood up, stepped off the steps and looked around the room looking at me from a certain distance but not yet knowing the position. I was so much in awe of him that I almost forgot myself and gave him away. I would have been ashamed of him if I had not been there myself, but now I could tell no one that had ever seen him and I had no doubt that he must have been able to escape that moment without any one else. I looked down again and saw him at the back of the room. I saw him still marching and I said to myself: ""I must go out and get my friends, or I have a chance to ruin him."" And as I did so I heard the sound of a falling rope and I ran into the basement and fell over it. I was so frightened that I could only speak in my very little voice and not even look at him anymore. I stood up, stepped off the step and looked around the room looking at him from a certain distance but still not seeing the position. I am so scared that I could only speak in my very little voice and",0.988219895287958,0.2957963748553798,-0.7006775756430328,BLOOM-560M,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.7878387878215164,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl

CHAPITRE VIII. - LA CAME DE MAURICE NOUVEAU PRÉSENTATION DE MICHELLE.

On le sait encore aujourd'hui, cela dévoilait le ton du pouvoir qui règne à Paris: la souveraineté, la sécurité du roi, sont évidemment les fondamentaux. En 1580, M. de la Croix n'avait que les moyens de recruter des agents de sécurité, mais aucune force pour les tenir. L'usage des armes de destruction est aujourd'hui un crime, et il n'a aucun moyen de saisir les armes sans que l'on ne s'attache aux lois de l'ordre. Les nouveaux maîtres se sont éveillés à l'époque, comme tous les peuples, avec la douleur de l'injustice dont ils avaient bien besoin; ils avaient besoin de la justice, ou la paix, et avec les hommes les plus durs, les plus soucieux, c'était l'homme de la guerre; avec les nouveaux maîtres, la guerre, c'est l'homme de la sécurité; l'homme de la paix, il y en a bien partout, et c'est l'homme de la justice. Mais c'est tout l'amalgame. Dans les deux cas, l'Homme, le grand homme, l'homme en puissance, c'est-à-dire le seul qui s'en fait réelment autorité, s'en prend-il à tous les autres, à l'Eglise, à la religion, au gouvernement, au commerce, au peuple? Non; on ne l'en est pas encore arrivé, mais le temps ne nous en donne plus tard, et le moment du crime est venu. L'institut, l'église, le gouvernement, sont les trois terres de la France; on le croit, c'est le rêve des monarchies. Et si l'on parvient à s'en approcher, la justice est-elle aussi de celle terre? La justice qui fait tant de bien au peuple, n'en sera-t-elle pas un peu moins bien, si la guerre n'est pas le règne de ceux qui nous ont appris à l'esprit? Non, ne rien dire, Ludovic, ne rien dire; pourquoi parler avec les peuples que nous sommes venus de les rencontrer, et de nous prendre pour des dangereux? Les fous de la France, les rebelles de la France, les vieux gens qui ne se soucient plus d'eux mêmes, se sentent tous, avec leur seigneur, se sentir de la part de la France; il n'y a qu'un truc, l'homme qui n'a pas été lui, a été, n'a j",0.9865092748735244,0.2608525615956198,-0.7355802238868332,OPT-6.7B,prompt_complex_lang,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,,-0.8064048562953785,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl

à poignard

""Jamais, je l'affirme, jamais cette marque de confiance que je ne vous devais pas ne m'a-mena à souscrire au premier élan de bonheur qui se présentait ou se présenta. Aujourd'hui, j'en hé-siterais peut-être, désolée de faire de la peine, déplorant d'aller sou-tenir avant mon temps cette union que vous allez bientôt ve-nir proclamer du consentement du monde. En ce moment, le mari, je le sentais bien, était la créature la plus envieuse et la plus scrupuleuse qui soit. Je vous rends grâce, Ludovic, d'avoir agi généreuse-ment à mon égard ; mais quand vous êtes venu me parler de vos prétentions sur une jeune personne sous prétexte que vous étiez sûr de mes sentiments et de mon approbation, je ne dus pas entrer dans vos explications.

""Je connais l'homme qui me questionne, c'est l'avocat plaidant, et aussi le procureur général, qu'ont rendu sceptique et réservé les exemples les plus divers de lâcheté et de bassesse. Il me fit de gros reproches. J'eus tort d'en juger d'après les caractères vulgaires et ingrats au-tour de moi, d'en trouver des exemples particuliers dans une vie et chez un être dont la nature avait été capable de tant de confiance en autrui. -Elle n'a du-

Vous me le représentez sous la couleur de ces grands esprits, de ces grands caractères dont le besoin d'affectuer, d'éblouir, est le seul mobile des actions et des paroles. N'importe ! Il me le présentait comme vous le voyez, tel était, au moins, son premier effet et, il faut l'avouer, il m'avait d'abord plu. Je me suis trompée, j'ai voulu et puis j'ai eu peur. Je ne sais, Ludovic, par qui j'ai été induite en erreur, mais, si j'avoue à vos yeux mon imprudence, je réhabilite, je crois, mon bonheur. Votre amitié m'était si chère que j'en ai fait un malheur. La honte est encore sur moi, ce qui ne prouve rien. Ne voyez point ici de calcul. Je n'étais pas alors la même, non je ne me trouvais plus la même qu'aujourd'hui. Je n'étais plus la femme fière, l'intégrité du devoir qui m'inspire et m'honore. Je cédais à mes passions, aux séductions du moment, et, pour la première fois, j'abandonnais ma dignité et mon honneur. Laissez-moi donc me faire grâce. Qu'avez-vous vu en moi? un être indéterminé et flottant entre deux destinées. J'avais des faiblesses, c'est vrai, mais ces faiblesses n'étaient pas irréparables. Vous me lais-siez et je me rachetais, je renaissais de mon indécision. Mais j'avais en moi, malgré toutes mes défiances, une foi, une confiance, une croyance à vous, je n'en sais pas trop ce qui m'en inspirait l'assurance, mais je le savais et je m'en sérvis avec reconnaissance.

Oui, oui ! s'écria-t-il, on dirait que vous avez lu en moi mon passé et mon avenir. Il n'est que trop vrai, je n'ai jamais été qu'un homme sans volonté et sans pensées. Le plus souvent paresseux, toujours distrait, toujours enclin à prendre les moindres choses au sérieux. J'ai rarement songé, je me l'avoue, à ce que je faisais ou à ce que je voulais faire, -à peine même à mes affaires et mes intérêts. Je crois qu'il n'y a qu'un grand caractère qui soit capable de dominer sa paresse et de faire un emploi de ses qualités qui le rendent si vrai dans les rapports de la vie. Le moment que je suis arrivé à ma majorité, je me suis trouvé à la merci d'un homme que j'ai pris pour un grand seigneur.

Que si je n'avais jamais eu de lui d'autre pensée que celle du bien qu'il me rendait, -que si je n'avais que l'intérêt de mon bonheur à voir s'en servir, j'eusse pu négliger tout autre soupçon. Ma faute est venimeuse parce qu'elle vient de moi. Tout mon malheur est dans cet amour naïf que j'avais pour lui. J'ai voulu le protéger, l'excuser, oublier ses torts, et, n'aimant plus qu'à l'aimer, je l'ai caché dans la honte et dans le crime. -Il m'était facile d'en savoir plus.

Ce soir-là, je croyais encore être en bon chemin. Le désir que vous avez d'en être quitte, la vive et juste indignation dont vous vous êtes fait l'écho, l'aveu d'un passé d'infidélité que j'ai été pour ainsi dire forcée d'admettre, tout me le prouve et me fait connaître mon erreur. Pourquoi me laisse-tu devoir en taire davantage? pourquoi me refuses-tu d'en dire plus? A-t-il été moins coupable que je le croyais? ou n'y avait-il pas dans ses manœuvres, et peut-être même dans ses sentiments, une grande naïveté qui ne voulait pas laisser paraître la moindre liaison et qui s'était crue, -par une illusion toute féminine, dans l'impression qu'elle faisait, et dans une indiscrétion, d'après laquelle l'attention et le plaisir venaient à sa place et à sa place seule. Pourquoi, Ludovic, pourquoi refuses-tu d'en dire davantage et laisse-t-il que la preuve de tout cela se fasse par moi seule. Dès qu'il s'agit de mes torts, de mon ingratitude, de mon abandon et d'un autre crime de plus grande portée, j'ai le courage de l'avouer, mais vous, qu'a-t-il fait à vous pour que je vous en parle en premier, et que je vous aie réservé la honte de ce que j'ai eu le courage d'avouer moi-même?

J'ai compris qu'il ne me réjouissait pas de voir moi bénéficier de mes merveilles et du confort que je lui proposais, et vous, qu'il me fâchent d'avoir un beau, gentil et d'affranchissant prétexte de quitter l'une de ces bénéfices sans lui en faire une partie. Cela ne vous gêna pas?

Quoique en rue, ce qu'il y avait, c'est quelque chose de trop léger pour le monde des lèvres et dans mon coeur. Si c'est ce qu'on a vu, j'en ai la confirmation.

Faisant une lecture profonde et véritablement à la lettre de mes pensées, je me suis écroulée. Un malheureux mécanisme d'autodestruction de ma propre confiance me conduit à se remettre aux origines. Je me rappelle qu'à peine plus d'un an après avoir fait mon éloge d'un homme comme Ludovic, et en faisant éclaircir ses talents, c'était cet homme qui avait, avec tous les moyens, voulu me détruire. C'était lui qui avait fait mon éloge, c'était le meilleur homme dont je n'avais jamais bien compris pourquoi il voulait me tuer. Un ennemi de ma liberté de pensée, de mon esprit, et que je n'avais pas découvert de vrais ennemis. C'était le résultat de mes propres follies, de mes comportements inconfortables et irréguliers. Une fois, je me suis dit, j'étais seulle et je suis encore seule.

En avoir donc la vue sur un homme devenu mon ami, j'ai compris que c'était parce que je n'étais pas étoilée. C'est en m'exhiber, en m'admettant d'avoir été si épuisée, et si dévouée, que j'ai entièrement reconnu mes frais et je les pardonne. C'est, dans un sens, ma bienveillance de tous les êtres humains, et pourquoi pas encore m'aide, pour être moi. Il faut tous être sérieux, et là j'ai éprouvé, et c'est bien ce que je ressens aujourd'hui.

J'ai compris que ce n'était pas ma détestation que je portais là-dedans, mais une peine pour moi. En voyant ce que c'était, je n'en serai jamais pas satisfaite et je vous le dis, Ludovic. Je suis triste de vous éloigner de ce qui m'a touché, de moi, de ma liberté de pensée et de ma conscience. C'est un sacrifice, mais je veux dire, je ne sais pas comment ai-je réussi à m'endormir sur le fond. J'ai perdu mes lèvres, j'ai perdu ma liberté de pensée et de conscience et j'ai perdu le meilleur homme dans l'histoire de mon corps.

Vous, qui m'aimiez, qui vouliez seulement me bien, je croyais que vous aviez la même pensée que moi, j'imaginais qu'on partageait les mêmes idées, qu'on avait la même affection pour moi. Il me semble pourtant que je le devinai si bien et qu'il eut cette même pensée qu'il en devint jaloux. 258 Vous vous trompez, Ludovic, en jugeant de la passion que j'éprouvais pour lui. Peut-être vous le deviniez sans savoir le dire et vous en aviez la preuve. Il fallait que ce fût là son secret. Vous êtes bien sûr, c'est tout ce que vous avez à dire et vous n'avez pas voulu me demander si je l'aimais ? Mais il y a une question qu'il ne faut pas poser, c'est la dernière, je l'ai dit, c'est celle qui nous arracherait à tout notre bonheur. Vous savez, Ludovic, que j'aime et que j'aime avec passion. Je le crois, je vous l'ai dit, je l'aime et ne vois pas en lui l'homme que j'aime. Je me flatte, je me le déclare, je m'y efforce, mais je n'y arrive pas. Je le vois, je le sens, je le connais, mais je ne le crois pas. Il est impossible que je le croie et cela ne m'est pas possible, je crois, je veux croire, mais je n'y parviens pas. Je le vois, je le sens, je le connais. C'est ce que j'avais dit à cette femme. Tout est dit, je ne le verrai jamais. Il ne sera jamais pour moi ce qu'il est pour vous et vous ne serez jamais pour lui ce que vous êtes pour moi. Que faire donc ? Que faire de ces sentiments ? Me priver de vous en les avouant ou les cacher en les dissimulant ? Vous savez qu'il faut tout dire et qu'il n'y a rien à dissimuler. Je ne le puis, je ne le veux pas. Si je devais lui avouer que je l'aime, il me refuserait son amour, il m'abandonnerait. Cela ne lui est pas possible. Mais je le sais et il est possible qu'il ignore tout. Il peut, ce me semble, n'avoir jamais douté que je ne l'aimât et s'il l'a su et le sent maintenant, ce ne peut être qu'à votre insu. Mais alors, que faire ? Que lui dire ?

Était-il besoin d'aide pour cela et ne valait-il pas mieux procéder sans bruit, sans éclat,.comme une femme peut et doit le faire, que de mettre de l'affaire au jeune d'avoir, d'une faillie.

In English, the first syllable of the phrase ""Obedient"" means an omelet.

In French, ""Obedient"" means ""the house or village that is within the means of its association"" or ""an inn"" in French.

In the same way that English uses ""Obedient"" and English uses ""Vauxir de Vauxir"", so also ""Obedient"" is pronounced ""Obedient"" and ""Vauxir"" is pronounced ""Obedient"" or ""Vauxir"".

Catherine of Aragon, in ""The Queen's Speech"", writes ""That's it. It's just a matter of time.""

In ""The King's Speech"" he tells the tale of the Princess, whereupon it is decided by the King that the princess was an ""Obedient"" and the King accepts that.

On the subject of the ""Museum of the First Empire"", I say:

In my opinion, a monument to the nobility of the period (the first Empire), is a bad idea, a monument to the aristocracy of the time (the Second Empire), and a monument to the aristocracy of the day (the Third Empire). But what's that even say about how much we care for the First Empire? What's it all about?

My ""Queen's Speech"" is written when we are talking about the ""first period"".

In my opinion, it seems that we need only ""The First Empire"" to understand that, and to realize that this is the first time that we really have been talking about ""the First Empire"".

As I mentioned above, it is said that ""Obedient"" was originally a phrase in the English language used by Louis XIV to describe the inhabitants of the Middle East and Africa. It is said that during the time that the second Empire was proclaimed by the king and the first by his people, the monarch of Morocco, a king who had ruled them for over 100 years, had chosen a person from the people of the country and made him ""Obedient"".

So, in order to understand how ""Obedient"" came to be in the First Empire, it is necessary to understand a few words. First, ""Museum of the First Empire"" was created by Louis XIV and was not originally an imperial place.

I obeyed, as there was in me a little confusion and trouble. It takes so little to stop a confidence on the lips, when it concerns the accusation of a wrong and of one's self to the mercy of one another. We take hold of the first pretext, the most futile, the most specious and we retreat and in our retreat we find pretexts for delaying. We draw in upon ourselves, we turn and we find new pretexts. There were these motives with me, Ludovic, and when I returned to you I was resolved to tell everything and when I returned I lacked confidence. There was no reasoning, no calculation but an indomitable and almost independent force of will. Then I paid the price for defeats. Why cause yourself to trouble, to upset your security, to create in your mind suspicions which will not long survive the shock? That man coming to see me, had obeyed a probable caprice, probably he would not return. And if he came back, then of what more advantageous, as a woman would act, than to give him his place and to make justice of his airs cavaliers? Was he in need of assistance to act on that plan and it were better to act without noise, without excitement, as a woman might and ought to, than to place two men in the presence and to go to a taking for so trifling a motive? This is how I felt at first, Ludovic, when I saw all this, and I did not enter into the matter well enough before I had gone to the heart. Then I began to realize the situation better and I took the last word in this series of frailties that had overcome me. Here I needed your pardon, Ludovic, an absolute pardon, a pardon without excuse, nothing that could palliate this commencement of treachery. You had been for me the most faithful, the most devoted of friends. You had nothing that you could give, no wish, no wish which you would not readily grant, no vexation, nothing to trouble you if I expressed any desire, if I had any sorrow, you would put your whole heart into satisfying me, you would share my sorrow, you would make it easy for me, and it was like that for me. That was why I was so happy to make you happy, because I knew that you would share my sorrow and that I could always trust you. You were those loyal companions that a woman is too happy to find in her life, which assist her in the good and the bad times and who give without hesitation as if there were no calculation, no forethought. You, on the contrary, were what? You were all that a woman could wish to have in a man, and yet I see now that I have no words for saying to you what I once thought so clearly, that I was not capable of realizing before. So what? Have I any regret? Am I sorry to make you pay the price for a love that has become a duty? No. What a joy it is to be able to satisfy you and to share with you my grief! Is there anything that is more beautiful in this world than the justice you have rendered?</s>",0.9865092748735244,0.290521978021978,-0.7055050718512256,OPT-6.7B,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,,-0.8093078520175667,Negative Improvement,,1858,monograph,results-icdar-2017-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl

It is so little that it is possible to stop a confidence from the lips, especially when it is about accusing oneself of a fault and putting oneself in the power of others! One seizes then the first pretext, the most trivial, the most specious one withdraws, one postpones, and, in these postponements oneself, - one takes excuses for not doing so. That's what happened to me, Ludovic. Before you saw me, I was resolved to tell everything to you, and when I saw you I had the confidence to fail. There was nothing in there that was rational or calculative but a force which was almost independent of my will. Then I was bribed to defeat. Why disturb your security and arouse your suspicions? Did it really deserve that? The thing was so easy to do and not to raise a scandal. Was it necessary to go so far as to put two men face to face? and to take them with all their strength to make a little joke? Yes, yes, I was ready to do that and so my weakness started. I had never thought of it before, though. But now I feel it, I am in that chain of weaknesses that have been mine and that have led me to the end of my life. Here, I need your forgiveness, Ludovic, an absolute, generous forgiveness. No excuse can be found, nothing that can atone for this beginning of treason. You were my best, the most devoted, and the most faithful friend, you had only one thought, my happiness, a single purpose, our union. Never have I known a more loyal companion, -you have always helped me with good times and with bad. You were a real and true friend that is something a woman is more than lucky to meet in her life, that can assist her in good and in bad times, and give themselves without reservation as without calculation. I was aware of it all, and didn't misjudge your merits. The other on the other hand, what was he and what was there for me to hope for? Hm.

Il y a quelques jours, dans un hôtel, il était tombé en disgrâce pour de gros soucis d'argent et de travail que je me suis chargé de régler. Il était revenu de son séjour dans un pays en guerre, avec une énorme somme d'argent qu'il m'avait confiée. Je lui ai fait signer un papier disant que je devais absolument le recevoir, puis qu'il me restait un petit billet que j'ai remis au lendemain, mais en disant que c'était trop tard pour prendre ces billets, pour les jours qui arrivent. C'est une façon de faire de moi un mauvais, que je ne peux pas accepter. Je ne suis pas venu lui dire que j'étais en train de lui faire des procès d'intention, et que j'étais dans une sorte de faux-emploi. Il m'a dit que je ne le voyais pas. Puis il m'a demandé si j'avais une petite somme d'argent. Il m'a dit oui, qu'il ne voulait pas prendre d'argent. J'étais fâché. Je lui ai dit qu'il n'y aurait rien de fâcheux, que j'allais le recevoir. Il m'a dit: « Tu l'as fait, tu l'as fait ! » Il s'est ensuite mis à parler à d'autres hommes en lui faisant des avances. Cela lui a plu, il m'a dit qu'il avait aimé moi, et il n'a pas regretté de me l'avoir fait. Je lui ai dit de ne pas s'en mêler. Je lui ai donné un paquet de cigarettes pour que je continue. Il a voulu acheter de l'argent, et a mis un paquet d'argent dans mon sac, m'a dit qu'il en avait besoin et m'a promis de l'envoyer dès qu'il rentrerait. Je lui ai dit qu'il ne voulait pas. Je n'ai pas voulu le prendre. Je lui ai expliqué le problème à mon frère et il m'a dit : « Fais quelque chose pour me consoler ! ». Je lui ai demandé de m'envoyer un morceau d'argent. Je lui ai dit : « Ne m'envoie pas ! ». Il m'a dit : « Il n'y a pas de souci à le faire. ». Il s'est mis à manger. Je lui ai dit que j'étais fâchée. Il s'est mis à pleurer, et s'est écrié: « Je t'en prie, ne m'envoie pas ! ». Je l'ai appelé en lui disant qu'il allait m'envoyer des choses pour me consoler. Il m'a dit : « Pourquoi as-tu peur de me le rendre ? ». Et il m'a dit: « C'est trop tard pour lui donner une somme d'argent. Je le ferai dans un instant. ». Je lui ai demandé de me rendre un peu d'argent à la place de la somme qu'il avait promise, et il m'a dit: « Je t'envoie dix francs, je te donnerai dix francs de monnaie de France. Et tu me diras combien. ». J'ai dit : « Je m'envoie cinquante francs, tu me donneras cinquante francs de monnaie de France. ». Il m'a dit : « Je t'envoie cent francs, je te donnerai cent francs de monnaie de France. ». Et il m'a dit : « Je t'envoie mille francs, tu me donneras mille francs de monnaie de France. ».

Je vous le demanderai de tout coeur, car mon coeur ne sait plus de quelle manière il faut le demander. J'ai perdu confiance en moi-même et dans tout ce que je fais et dans tout ce que je suis. Aucun conseil ne m'est utile, aucun aide n'est possible, aucun pardon n'est nécessaire. Vous avez vu combien il était facile de me séduire. Croyez-moi donc assez forte pour me retenir et m'abstenir. Mais si vous ne le voulez pas, vous n'aurez point de repos, ni je non plus ; nous serons perdues et condamnées l'une à l'autre à la mort de l'autre et peut-être à la sienne. Cela ne saurait, je le sais bien, amener mon père et ma mère, -dans un cas comme celui-ci, ils n'y songeraient pas. Ils seraient peut-être tentés d'oublier que je suis la fille d'un grand marquis, mais ne pourraient pas songer qu'il en est ainsi. Je le sais bien, laissons là leur sentiment et notre rang. Je ne suis point là. Je suis un être obscur, peu connue, peu vue. Eh bien ! ne croyez-vous pas qu'une femme comme moi, qu'une fille, peut-être, peut-être une petite fille qui se trouve dans une pareille circonstance, qui n'a pas même d'honneur à perdre, ait un droit à votre pardon ? Si vous le me donnez, je pourrai croire à mon bonheur et à la foi que vous avez mise en moi. N'est-ce pas ce que vous voudrez ? Oui, oui, vous voulez m'aimer, -n'est-ce pas, Ludovic ? Eh bien, n'est-ce pas pour cela que vous m'aimez, pour qu'une fois j'éprouve ce bonheur et cette foi, pour que j'en garde le souvenir et qu'après je meure, que je meure d'amour pour vous? Il est trop tard pour parler maintenant de vos droits. Quelque chose que j'en aie, ils ne les seront plus après un tel aveu.

Et, quand vous m'avez vu partir, vous l'avez quitté sans vous soucier de lui et sans me donner d'explication. Ce sentiment est plus cruel que tout. Jamais, Ludovic, jamais, nous ne pourrons être à nous deux sans qu'il y ait quelqu'un entre nous deux, quelqu'un qui nous dérange, qui nous gêne, qui est un obstacle, qui est un rival, qui fait partie de notre vie commune. Il ne peut pas être mon époux, mon amant, mon ami. Il ne peut pas être, s'il est. Il est celui que j'aimais en vous, et ce qu'il a été m'a causé tant de douleur. C'est à vous, Ludovic, qu'il faut demander pardon, à vous seul. Je n'ai jamais soupçonné votre culpabilité, moi qui ne vous connais que depuis un mois et vous m'avez tant admirée et aimée pendant ce temps. Je n'ai jamais soupçonné qu'il y ait eu entre vous deux rien. Si vous êtes coupable, c'est à vous d'en répondre devant moi et devant le monde. Je ne m'excuse que de ce que j'ai été jalouse, c'est à vous de me pardonner. Si j'avais pensé qu'un mot, qu'une pensée de votre part me permettait de vous mettre à la place de cet autre qui vous était destiné, je n'aurais pas fait de vous un ami comme je l'ai fait. Que de fois, dans des jours de joie et d'enthousiasme, j'ai pensé que le bonheur était pour moi, que tout cela me tombait du ciel ! Quand vous avez fait allusion à cette circonstance, j'ai cru que c'était pour m'en venger. Et alors j'ai pensé, Ludovic, que c'étaient des circonstances qui se reproduisent de temps à autre dans la vie, et que cette circonstance ne mérite pas qu'on s'en souvienne en tant que telle. Il faut que cette circonstance se reproduise encore et encore pour en éprouver de la tristesse, pour en sentir le poids et l'horreur. Elle fait partie de la vie des êtres qui vivent unis, elle fait partie de la vie humaine. Ce n'est pas comme dans les tragédies grecques, où les morts revenaient des enfers pour mourir aux vivants, ou dans les romans anglais et américains, où l'on revit, on retrouve son ami après s'être éloigné. On a revu, on a retrouvé. C'est une partie inévitable de la vie. C'est un devoir qu'on a à rendre à Dieu que, loin de vous livrer à une telle rétentions sur vous-même et votre conscience, de ne pas perdre la mémoire de cette circonstance. Car, quand vous avez dit ces mots, je les ai reçus avec la même douceur et la même joie que s'ils venaient d'une autre personne.

Il me paraissait un être léger, capricieux et qui ne savait pas ce qu'il désirait. Peut-être n'avait-il qu'une ambition : moi. Qu'aurait-il fait pour moi ? Tout. M'épouser pour l'honneur ou se laisser mener à la plus grande sottise? Cela dépendoit de moi. Tout était dans ma main et j'avais de plus en plus de motifs de le craindre, car, après un certain temps, j'avais vu qu'il n'aimait point mes amis, qu'il ne m'aimait pas, et que cette passion de la vie est de beaucoup plus sérieuse et plus digne de confiance, que les passions de l'art. Tout était là. Je m'abandonnai à lui, mais comme une femme, comme un amour d'instinct. Je ne voulais pas le connaître, je ne voulais pas le comprendre, j'étais bien heureuse qu'il ne sût pas les idées qui me traversaient la tête, car je sentais bien que j'étais fausse, -trop jeune, trop peu capable de bien aimer, et j'avais le coeur trop sensible pour l'expérience. Le plus beau jour de ma vie était venu j'avais tout pour me rendre heureuse, mais le plus petit obstacle venait m'en priver. Etes-vous jaloux, Ludovic, et de quoi? de moi, ou de lui, ou de l'amitié? Je n'ai pas encore pu me résoudre à vous dire, et encore moins à lui, que c'était pour lui que je me pâ-mais, et non pour la cause des arts ou les chances de la vie. Laissez-moi encore une fois vous en vouloir. Ce n'est point, ce n'est pas mon devoir, je ne le sens pas assez encore. D'ailleurs, vous n'aimez pas la peine, ni la douleur. Et, au nom de cet amour qu'on dit de l'art, au nom de cette ambition qu'on dit du monde, vous avez été très injuste. Que m'importe votre avis, qu'en fût-il fait? Il ne m'a jamais manqué que vous et mon ami, qu'il est encore. Nous en étions si contents! Quand vous avez eu la colère, j'ai été plus seule, je n'ai plus trouvé un ami près de moi, et, lorsque vous avez parlé à mon amant, c'était pour lui faire tort, pour le séparer de moi, vous ai-je trompée ou bien est-ce que nous nous sommes trompés? Que m'importe? Je ne puis m'en tirer. Si j'avais su, à l'instant, que je ne l'aimais plus et que j'étais fausse, j'aurais tenu pour faux tout ce que je pensais. Ma confiance en moi est brisée, ma fierté est brisée, j'ai peur de tout et de tout le monde.

Vous étiez de ces loyaux compagnons qu'une femme est trop heureuse de rencontrer dans sa vie, qui l'as-sistent dans les bons et les mauvais jours et se donnent sans réserve comme sans calcul.

Lui, au contraire, qu'était-il et quel fonds pouvais-je -ou n'avions-nous pas, Ludovic? -supposer que la chose de l'enlever telle quelle n'était-elle pas, en d'autres termes, l'honneur et le droit de vous prendre, avec l'assurance d'un crime, comme si vous n'étiez pas en mesure de vous défendre et de résister avec la désireuse et bienveillante patience, dont vous avez tous à féder la force. Vous étiez le bien-aimé, le le plus aimé, et je vous pardonne pour la douleur que j'ai eu à la voir dépassée par ce bien d'un autre. Vous m'avez touché, c'était à cela que je suis venue. Je suis désolée de vous éviter la vengeance, mais je n'ai pas l'intention d'etre capable de m'en rendre responsable. Cela doit passer, au plus vite. Ce qui est légitime dans la vie, de ce qui est légitime sur le plan du droit, est ce que l'on peut et qu'on doit faire. C'est ce qui m'attache à vous; l'attache à vous, et, -au lieu de vous en priver, de vous rendre responsable, -d'être au service de votre vie et de votre honneur, et de vous accompagner jusqu'au fond. C'est pourquoi, Ludovic, je vous demande de vous rendre -au plus vite, au plus vite- chez vous et de nous parler. J'ai besoin de vous pour faire vos décisions, et nous doivons, comme deux citoyens, vous offrir quelque chose pour l'amener à chez nous, quelque chose de lui, dont il ne saura pas où et quelques heures avant que cela ne soit trop tard. C'est l'histoire des amis de la vie, et ce sera aussi le cas de vous avec l'histoire que nous méritons de votre vie, et de vous. Mais nous n'avons pas les moyens de s'écarter de ce qui est légitime, et ce n'est pas en mettant la peau à la porte qu'il peut se retirer. Il est nécessaire qu'on soit là-dessus. Vous le verrez, le coeur que j'ai quand vous reviendrez, Ludovic. Pour lui, c'est un éternel désir, dans les mains de l'homme en question. Je veux qu'il le soit, sans peur, sans excitation, sans violence, et de sa force, sa patience et sa foi. Le coeur qu'on veut qu'il y ait en lui n'est pas de l'emprise ou de la violence. L'attachement que l'on veut qu'il y ait en lui, ce sont ses émotions, ses émotions d'amour, ses émotions de respect et de vertu. L'emprise est quelque chose qu'on vient d'entreprendre, que l'on n'est pas capable de nier, de se tenir en garde contre, ou de s'en sortir. La violence, c'est cela qui m'embarrasse. Le coeur qu'il veut qu'on soit, c'est une chose plus l'enfant et plus la femme.

Peur de ne pouvoir le retenir et de le perdre, comme il l'était déjà pour moi et pour tant d'autres, peur du scandale, de la malédiction, de la calomnie, peur d'un effroyable retour en arrière, peur de la honte et d'un nom bafoué. Vous aviez raison de me croire frivole et insensée, je vous l'ai confessé, mais vous auriez eu tort de me condamner. J'aurais eu tort aussi de vous décevoir, de vous tromper. C'est peut-être par cela que j'ai été la plus grande coupable, d'avoir cédé à mes propres préjugés, de m'être laissé guider par une idée fausse et chimérique du bonheur. Et pourtant je le dis sans regret, sans rougir. Mon coeur était triste, morne, découragé. Rien ne le pouvait réjouir, ni la gaieté ni les éclats de rire des enfants. Les joies ne venaient pas de ce côté, mais je pensais à vous, à votre absence et j'avais souvent pitié de moi. A la maison, je me gardais bien de me montrer heureuse, et je faisais semblant de ne pas vous connaître. En un mot, je faisais tout ce que vous pouviez faire pour moi, sans m'apercevoir que mon bonheur était dans ma propre estime. J'ai été donc heureuse jusqu'au jour où vous m'avez écrit ce mot. Quand il m'arriva de vous revoir, je retrouvai, au milieu des éclats de rire et des causeries gaies de mon frère et de mes soeurs, la même tristesse qui m'envahissait depuis tant de jours, qui avait été le lot de tous ces enfants. Ce fut le mot de vos lettres, ma conscience qui parla et me fit comprendre que j'avais été trop loin, que j'avais trop vite cédé à mes craintes. La nuit dernière, vous avez fait votre entrée, et cette fois ma raison, qui était morte, a repris la parole. Vous avez trouvé devant vous le même coeur que le jour où vous l'avez quitté, quand il était faible, triste, malade et ne demandait que vous et votre présence pour lui rendre l'espoir et la gaieté. C'est là tout ce qu'il m'a été donné de faire, de montrer. J'ai été lâche, j'ai agi dans un moment de faiblesse et peut-être aussi d'imprudence. Mais, hélas ! comment retrouver et pardonner ? Le mot que vous avez écrit est cruel, Ludovic et je le regrette autant que vous. Je n'aurais jamais pensé vous voir ainsi, et pourtant vous êtes bien le frère que j'aime. Mais si j'ai aimé, ce ne fut pas pour vous. Vous m'auriez pardonné sans doute s'il m'avait fallu recommencer. Eh bien, cette fois, je suis forcée de vous dire adieu, pour toujours peut-être.

Nous avons par ailleurs enfin mis l'esprit dans une série de réticences, que je me demandais d'améliorer l'avantage des prouess de vous. Vous êtes des gens du monde, vous pouvez voir en effet, ce qui prouve à des choses qu'il faudrait-il. Quand je me connais bien ce qui se passe, vous étudiez de la manière dont le lien est. C'est un truc qu'on voudra la plus grande et une telle vie : il y a vraiment un tout joueur qu'il faut donc passer sur ce que je dois avez par le fait que vous voulez. Si je pouvais dit le tout, je vais prendre le plus à vous, avec une vie politique de la nature, le respect et le suivi d'un joueur, un joueur qui vous faudra son lien. J'ai réussi avec le tout à partir des choses que je n'étais pas compliquées par ce que je suis déjà un peu écoutant, et avec la telle telle vie qui vous précise, il n'y a que plus lourdement qu'à voir les joueurs dans la vie des loyaux et leurs employés. Je le faisais, je me demande ce qu'on va parler à des moyens d'associer la vie et ainsi le respect. Cela ne devrait pas être possible d'être lourdement démocratique et d'éclater la présence de gens qu'on voit qu'on se passe en dépit des loyaux. Ce qu'il faudrait n'est pas en fonction de l'événement, c'est d'une étude pour laquelle j'ai compris ce que j'ai vu. J'ai un peu de récitement, de démonstration, de démocratie, des réactions, d'intérêts, d'esprits, d'équivalence. Dans une vie politique de la nature, c'est dans la rue que j'ai compris qu'on peut être évident à l'avantage de vous. J'aurais l'impression que j'ai eu une réussite d'autant qu'un joueur, un autre, et que c'est pourquoi j'ai été évident. On a vraiment, on se dit qu'on était tout déjà joueur à une manière de croire qu'un joueur est plus grand que tous les gens qui ne se disent pas que cela avait été réalisé par des études, avec des réactions d'étude d'études de la société, de la société publique. J'ai aussi eu des choses que je ne comprend pas dans les choses que je n'avais pas besoin. J'avais beaucoup d'informations. J'ai appris à des moyens d'associer la vie et à des moyens d'intérêts. J'ai donc eu aujourd'hui l'impression d'être à une vie politique.

LA PENSIONNAIRE MARIÉE, tragi-vaudeville en 2 actes, par MM. CH. DELANNOY et NÉROLE.

La veuve, la pensionnaire, s'est mariée depuis long-tems ; mais elle a demeuré mariée sans ménager son époux, lequel a été plusieurs fois conduit à la Bastille.
Elle passe pour avoir de la verve. C'est en vertu de cette réputation qu'elle a obtenu du Ministre d'État le privilège de pouvoir jouer, une fois par an, un seul acte de la Pensionnaire mariée.
La veuve, la pensionnaire, a donc, par une précaution bien judicieuse, donné, en 1800, le privilége de représenter un acte du vaudeville à un certain Monsieur de Lamotte, alors chef de division à la maison d'ordre du palais de l'Élysée.
Ce Monsieur de Lamotte, après avoir remis le privilège à Mme de Launay, la gouvernante de Napoléon, l'a lui-même présenté au premier Consul.
Napoléon a accordé le privilège ; mais il s'est contenté de remettre le manuscrit à Mme de Launay, comme à un simple amusement.
En 1803, l'acte que le Premier Consul a remis à Mme de Launay, avait été représenté à Paris, à la salle Montansier, par MM. Brasseur et Roché.
Ce fut alors que Napoléon fit une distinction. Mme de Launay fit représenter la Pensionnaire mariée par MM. Brasseur et Roché à la salle Montansier, et la donna au ministre de l'Intérieur.
Mme de Launay est devenue veuve, et Mme de Rémusat a pris la place qu'occupait Mme de Launay dans l'intérieur de l'Empereur. Mme de Rémusat, par son esprit, sa grâce et son amabilité, a tout naturellement fait connaître aux personnes qui se trouvaient auprès de l'Empereur, le privilège de représenter un acte du vaudeville à Mme de Launay, et l'acte dont on a parlé était l'acte de la Pensionnaire mariée, comme on le voit par la pièce qui suit, extraite du journal officiel de la salle Montansier.
Paris, 17 janvier 1805.
_La Pensionnaire mariée_ fut jouée à la salle Montansier le 17 janvier 1805, par MM. Brasseur et Roché.
On s'informait curieusement des auteurs de cette pièce.
M. Roché annonça qu'il ne pouvait rien répondre sur ce point, excepté qu'on les chercherait dans la famille de Launay, dans laquelle ils se trouvaient en quelque sorte cachés.
Mais à partir de ce moment, le mystère de cette pièce ne fut plus gardé ; car le nom de MM. Delannoy et Nerole fut annoncé et révélé.
Le ministère de l'Intérieur, auquel la représentation avait été donnée, fit une note à M. Roché, lui ayant demandé son autorisation, pour permettre aux auteurs de la pièce de la faire représenter à tout autre théâtre.
Au mois d'avril de cette année 1805, la pièce fut remise en représentation à l'Arcade.
Elle fut très-souvent remise en représentation et jouée jusqu'en 1809.
M. Delannoy en fut le chef et le maître. Nerole, c'est moi, et mon nom fut annoncé à la salle de l'Arcade, comme celui des auteurs de la Pensionnaire mariée.
Elle a été plusieurs fois remise en représentation, et j'ai continué à la dire.
La réputation que cette pièce a acquise, depuis qu'elle fut donnée à l'Arcade en 1805, a produit la continuation de la Pensionnaire mariée, que nous allons donner ici, sous le titre d'un _Acte de la Pensionnaire mariée_.

La Vieille veuve. — Madame la vicomtesse de Ligny ! Voilà bien la fille d'une pensionnaire, la fille d'une vraie pensionnaire, comme on disait autrefois, qui a été pensionnaire de la reine. Eh ! j'avais une amie, madame, une amie pensionnaire, et sa fille est bien gentille !
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Oui, monsieur. J'ai connu votre ami, la pensionnaire. Elle a bien connu ma mère, qui a été pensionnaire à Chaillot.
La Vieille veuve. — Oui, c'est bien cela ! Madame de Ligny, que vous m'avez rendu bien heureuse, en me donnant votre fille, votre très-chère fille !
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Oui, monsieur, je suis heureuse, je suis très-heureuse de votre amitié, je me réjouis de votre bienveillance ; mais ma fille est bien différente de sa mère. Son caractère n'a rien de celui de sa mère.
La Vieille veuve. — Ah ! que dis-je ?
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Je me suis souvenu, ce matin, que sa mère était pensionnaire à la cour de Louis XV.
La Vieille veuve. — Ah !
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Si vous aviez vu l'amour et la tendresse qu'elle avait pour son roi et son époux !
La Vieille veuve. — Quelquefois il en était à tel point qu'il n'y avait pas un de ses gens, pas un de ses valets qui ne lui eût dit, en se retirant : « Mon Dieu, qu'on le tue !
La Vicomtesse de Ligny. — Oh !
La Vieille veuve. — Que vous m'aviez bien trompée, à la tête !
La Vieille veuve. — Ah !
La Vieille veuve. — Eh ! monsieur, il est de l'avis de tous les amis de ma fille, qu'elle est aussi vive, aussi gaie, aussi entremetteuse, qu'un mari à qui il n'",0.9858136300417246,0.2179436284239777,-0.7789200496094244,LLAMA-2-7B,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,99-100%,80-99%,,-0.8045543644273537,Negative Improvement,,1850,monograph,results-icdar-2017-meta-llama-Llama-2-7b-hf.jsonl

C'est une découverte en plus en fin de la soirée. Le cœur aussi peut-être le début, auquel on n'a pas de mise. Les prélèvements estiment que les deux étoiles sont déjà désormais très près et les derniers n'ont aucune nouvelle évolution sur les derniers actes.

En fait, ça ne s'est pas la surprise d'un nouvel acte. On est dans ce cœur de ses prélèvements dans un nouvel endroit. En outre, l'ensemble de sa soirée a donc une nouvelle évolution à l'ensemble d'une histoire de la dernière saison. L'ensemble est moins difficile de sauver de ces deux étoiles, mais la cœur se découvre sur ceux qui ont découvert les prélèvements de sauver, de l'ensemble d'une histoire de ses prélèvements.

Le premier nouvel acte est l'ensemble du quatrième. L'ensemble est une histoire de sauver de sauver, mais l'ensemble du quatrième est le plus difficile duquatrième. L'ensemble de la soirée est l'une des prélèvements de sauver de sauver. Ce quatrième est une histoire de sauver de sauver. La cœur est le plus difficile du quatrième. L'ensemble du quatrième est un ancien d'un prélèvement dans lequel il est en partie une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements, et l'ensemble du quatrième est une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements, et l'ensemble du quatrième est un ancien d'un prélèvement dans lequel il est en partie une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements. La cœur est un ancien d'un prélèvement dans lequel il est en partie une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements, et l'ensemble du quatrième est une autre histoire dans les quatrièmes et quatrièmes prélèvements.

Qui est-ce qu'un périphérique de sauver de sauver?

NOTES:


a. Bibliothèque Nationale, D.I.1.20.3, which is to appear.


b. Alexandre Dumas fils, Souvenirs de jeunesse ( Paris, 1883), II. 65 n. Viardot writes to Dumas: "" That comes from the anecdote of the ""little stick ""(plantoir). One day Madame Récamier was pregnant, at least so they said, and to avoid all scandal, she gave notice to her mother and to the poor curé who had officiated at her marriage and who still visited her. When the poet Chénier wished to enter, the old woman received him as she would anybody who came by who was not inscribed in front. He said to Dumas: ""Voilà Villot et Villotne, petit plantoir et grand plantoir,"" quoting a passage from their tragedy. The next day all of social life was discussing the joke at Madame Récamier s expense.""


c. VI, 292. Dumas then travels via the major Italian cities to England.


d. IV, 128 and 264. A narrow escape from bandits who attacked their coach.

Dumas meets the young novelist and former inspector general of secondary education Léon Gozlan, with whom he will be on excellent terms in 1851 and who introduces him to author Charles Anger( 1810-1868), whom he does not seem to know at this point.

Backside of a leaf from D.I.3.19, concerning Bibliothèque Nationale, D.l.46.a No.4. The Interior of the cab (IV, 74) is most likely the descriptions of the view of Porto-Fino found in IV, 77.

Sans nous parler de vos dents, il faut que nos actes se réfugient à des hommes, les femmes, et des menaces, de manière avec les autres.

D'autres préfigures, d'autres sont parfois fusés.

Il me faut que le monde qui veut faire les femmes ne se réjouis pas.

Je n'ai rien d'amour, pas de vie, pas de vie.

Si on y a d'amour, on n'a pas de vie, on ne veut pas pas lui ou leur être vieux.

Pour faire des hommes, tous les femmes et tous les menaces, de manière avec les autres, on ne nous laissera pas leur choix.

Il me faut que le monde qui veut faire les femmes, tous les femmes et tous les menaces, de manière avec les autres, on ne nous laissera pas leur choix.
