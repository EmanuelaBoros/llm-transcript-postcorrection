RAIDERS IN FREDERICK LAND HAUL OF $84,000 Watchman Bound and Gagged While Old Whiskey Is Loaded Into Autos. Travelling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, twenty armed bandits early today swooped down on the Old Horpey Distillery, near Frederick, Md., and made off with $84,000 worth of choice old whiskey, leaving three Government watchmen bound and gagged, under threat of instant death if they attempted to raise an alarm. % Beyond the fact that an abandoned truck, laden with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey, was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore pike, there is no clue to the direction taken by the caravan.

The raid was evidently carried out after days of thorough preparation. The distillery is thought to have been under close surveillance, day and night, by bandit spies, who learned every movement of the watchmen. Seven Autos In Raid. With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning. While the motorcycle men scattered to guard every approach to the building, fifteen of the bandits broke into the office and overpowered the three watchmen-John R. Hemp, of Burkettaville, Md.: William Hart, of Baltimore, and John Moredock. of Baltimore. The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the ranges left more than two hours later. From fifty to sixty barrels of the aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons In all, was rolled from the building and leaded on the trucks and touring cars. A second, unidentified man was found in a truck and hauled away by two men who were on the other side of the building, who are reported to have kept an eye on the four other caravans. On the next morning, after an escort of forty miles of searchlight, they arrived at the Distillery in a van, which the four watchmen were riding in. On the next morning they saw that the distillery was still occupied and that there was a large crowd of men waiting for them. At this early hour, they were taken off by their motorbikes and taken to a storage area to be examined for evidence. Their bodies were subsequently disposed of by a warden and buried. After this day, and in the course of an inspection of the distillery, it is believed that the two watchmen were brought back to their places of rest and that the bodies recovered were indeed of the aged whiskey which they took, although this was not conclusive. The whiskey recovered was apparently more or less similar to those found in the old Whiskey Town of Chicago, but it was not until 1780. The discovery of the whiskey that day at a place unknown to the robbers did not result in their being murdered. The following day, the distillery was located by the following route, by way of the county, and in that place an independent, but respectable man, the Earl of Richmond, had set off to the Old Horpey Distillery in order to learn what to do in the matter. He had, at his request, received from the proprietors and operators of the Distillery Company (a company called 'C.R.P.' by his own nickname) of the distillery some whiskey which had been made on an island in North Africa. The proprietors, after their meeting with the estate agent of the distillery, and his wife, informed the owner that he would find it for him, and that it was as he had promised to use it, and that this was his plan for using it. He was then sent back to the distillery with his wife to see how they had obtained this whiskey and to inquire as to the proprietor's interest. A certain young man of the same name appeared in front of the proprietor and said that he had sent for this whiskey to him to obtain his business. His name was John B. Hampton. In a letter he had received from the owner of the Distillery, dated January 28, 1844, he asked for a ""salt and pepper"" of whiskey,",0.9802089059923036,0.5968268782081194,-0.3911227754006903,GPT-2,prompt_complex_lang,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.707448834742404,Negative Improvement,7 year 1922 type Article title http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/batch_dlc_bordercollie_ver02/data/sn84026749/0028076484A/1922030801/0007.pdf,,,results-overproof-gpt2.jsonl

Sheriff Jones was told that the entire caravan and its contents were searched and the contents were found to contain a large quantity of whisky. Some of the whiskey was seized, and a case of it was taken from the caravan and placed on the table of the sheriff. The watchmen were finally released at 3.30.

He found the telephone lines had been cut and was forced to walk, a long distance before he could spread the alarm. Sheriff James C. Jones was notified and telephoned the number of the sheriff's station, which he reported was at 855 and that the bandit was missing. A week later, while the highway was not clear, a motorcade of motorcyclists headed for the distillery, which was about a quarter of an hour after the raid had been reported, to see if it was possible to get them out of the town. The motorcade returned and was stopped by the sheriff's station which was a block south of the house where the five bandsit, on horseback, had set up in a ""Hemp Place"" a year ago. The bandit was arrested and charged with the theft of $1,800. He was given a three day sentence and ordered to pay the full fine. Thereafter, the bandit was placed under the supervision of a judge, who told him he was free to return to his home town. The Sheriff's Office immediately notified the Baltimore Police Department. An investigation was started into the case of the stolen liquor and was made public in a letter of intent from an agent of the state's Attorney General. It was sent to the Secretary of State and was signed by President Bush. The letters were sent to all the States. The case was sealed in March, 1990. Some weeks later, the State of Maryland issued a memorandum of understanding to the FBI, asking for information and providing copies of the letters. One of the agents in charge of the investigation, James B. Condon, was charged with being the third in command of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. A month later, on Sept. 15, 1990, Mr. Condon, in the course of his day job on the case, was removed from his position of head of the agency. It was not until a few weeks after that, when an investigation into the case was made public by a state prosecutor in Washington, D.C., that this official was fired from his position as a prosecutor. The new agent, Condon, was assigned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Baltimore and, by this time, was responsible for the case against the bandit. Although in fact Condon was not under the supervision of his current supervisor, he could also act as a deputy. He would work on the case at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms during the period when the FBI was involved, at least from the beginning. In the months preceding the incident, he was not responsible for much, if any, of the enforcement efforts that went on during the year.

When the whiskey was loaded on the trucks and autos, the bandits made their way out of the building, which was locked and guarded by their guards, and the caravan started, to the north. Hemp's Story Told to Police. Hemp, in telling his story to the police, said the ""agent"" made a thorough search of the building and finally told the watchmen he had found all the whiskey. He said the man then walked across the floor of the room and was joined by another bandit. who brought out a long-handled screw driver and turned the cap off one of the barrels. He said the bandits began transferring the liquor to the trucks. They said they were acting under instructions from Washington. Hemp said he knew there was none of the distillery's whiskey in the building, and told the men to turn the cap off a barrel of whiskey which had been placed in the office for their use. The bandits did so, and then Hemp pretended to be frightened and pleaded for his life. ""When I pretended to be frightened, they said we were to walk away from the office, and that we would not be harmed,"" Hemp said. ""We walked down the road for some distance, and then we decided to escape. They made us walk so far that we were afraid we might lose the trucks. ""I ran back through the field. When I looked back I saw one of the trucks turn from the highway into the fields, and the others followed. I could see the cars for a long time and finally gave it up, as I knew that the pursuit would be useless. I finally got back to the distillery and notified the sheriff. When I broke loose, I had to walk a long distance before I found any place to telephone for assistance. ""When we got there, it was almost two o'clock. I knew the bandits were so far ahead that they could not be overtaken."" Sheriff Jones' Men Busy. The sheriff's men were busy all day yesterday following up the report, but no clews were obtained until after midnight, when a patrolman learned that a truck load of stolen whiskey had been found near Jefferson, three miles from Frederick. The truck had been abandoned, and was found by Mr. and Mrs. John M. Carroll, who lives on the road near Jefferson. ""I found the liquor there at three o'clock this morning. I went down and found a note in the cab, and at once telephoned the police and the sheriff."" The note, addressed to Hemp and Hart, stated: ""The truck you left has been overtaken by the authorities. Good luck to you."" The truck had been abandoned with the door open, and a heavy rock had been placed on the brake. The police are trying to trace the origin of the note, and believe that it is the work of the same man who broke into the office at the distillery. The Sheriff has been busy rounding up his men and establishing a watch about the entire State. He has assigned one deputy to watch the road from Frederick to Washington, and a special squad has been organized. The whiskey which was taken from the distillery was ""barrel proof,"" a grade which is sold at $10 per gallon, and which is kept in barrels for many years before it is sold. The whiskey stolen was estimated to be worth from $75 to $84,000, but as it is barrel proof, it would be worth much more when sold in bottles. ""The whiskey was old and had not been distilled for ten years. It was the best whiskey which had been made there. The bandits must have known that."" -The New York Tribune. H. 8.

Traveling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, twenty armed bandits early today swooped down on the Old Horpey Distillery, near Frederick, MD, and made off with $84,000 worth of choice old whiskey, leaving three Government watchmen bound and gagged, under threat of instant death if they attempted to raise an alarm.

Beyond the fact that an abandoned truck, laden with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey, was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore pike, there is no clue to the direction taken by the caravan. It is thought the truck train may have broken a part, and the police are investigating.

The Washington Police Department, upon being notified of the raid, threw a cordon about the city, and close watch was kept on every road which the stolen liquor might be brought into the District. The raid was evidently carried out after days of thorough preparation. The distillery is thought to have been under close surveillance, day and night, by bandit spies who learned every movement of the watchmen.

Seven Autos in Raid

With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning. While the motorcycle men scattered to guard every approach to the building, fifteen of the bandits broke into the office and overpowered the three watchmen - John R. Hemp of Burkettaville, MD; William Hart of Baltimore; and John Moredock of Baltimore.

The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged, and an armed man stood over them until the raiders left more than two hours later. From fifty to sixty barrels of the aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons in all, were rolled from the building and loaded onto the trucks and touring cars. It took the bandits until nearly 4 o'clock to complete the loading of the caravan. Then, the motorcycle outposts reported the roads clear. The watchmen were admonished against any attempt to escape, and the caravan made off.

The bandits worked in absolute silence, and not a single shot was fired throughout the raid. The Old Horpey distillery is in a secluded place in a valley surrounded by hills, and it would seem that the bandits had to move a long distance, on good roads, to reach the Baltimore pike. A large number of bottles of ""Burgundy"" whiskey were discovered by the police. No clue has yet been found as to the whereabouts of the whiskey stolen. It is the belief of Sheriff Jones that it has been brought to Washington, as the motor cars used in the raid are too slow to make the journey to Baltimore and points beyond the city without being delayed at some way station. The police of Washington have been instructed to be on the lookout for the stolen liquor, and to apprehend the bandits if they show up. They are believed to be armed men. A BIG WHISKEY RAID The police department here has been busy all morning rounding up a gang of bootleggers. It is a big raid and a big haul was made by the police. The bootleggers have been very active in recent months, but their activity has been on the increase since the 13th amendment came into force. They are taking a chance by selling to the public in Washington at $5.00 and $6.00 a gallon, when they know it costs them only 65 cents. The police are after them and have been making some big hauls. The liquor is being brought in by the wagon load and the gangs that are bringing it in are very daring. They drive the wagons into the parks and other secluded places, where they can unload. Then they conceal the liquor where they hope to get it later. A lot of the gangs are operating in the parks and a number of officers are out after them. It is a hard job to locate them and bring them to justice. Many of them are armed and they make a fierce resistance when they are arrested. The police have discovered that one gang that has been working the parks is located somewhere in Southern Maryland. They have got the police on their track and soon they will be in the lockup. It is believed they are the gang that raided the old Horpey Distillery and took $84,000 worth of whiskey. It Is thought they are going to unload the whiskey on the streets and sell it to the public. They are also taking a chance that they may be caught and then it will be very bad for them.

Handkerchief were stuffed into their mouths and they were bound With the guards tied and aged, the bandits worked quickly. Tey appeared to have on plate knowledge of the location of the liquor, and lost no time opening the building. The trucks and touring cars","were packed and loaded. The watchmen, who had not been seen at the distillery for a few hours, came in and reported to the officer the contents of the caravan at 1 o'clock at night. The officer was immediately informed of the loss of life. The caravan was taken back to Maryland where the two watchmen were arrested and charged with treason. They were also charged with robbery and battery. The watchmen were found safe but the men who were captured were not convicted. The other bandits were sentenced to death. They were convicted in November of the year in which the accident occurred, but in November, 1916, were not released. Hemp had been sentenced to death in February of 1917, and Moredock and Hart, who were both present in the place of the accident, were sentenced in May of 1917. A telegram from Washington informed the Government that the bandits had been released, and the caravan was loaded back to Baltimore in July of 1916, but there was no trace of the watchmen until October of that year, when a notice was sent to the citizens informing them that all had been freed. The government was informed that the men who had been freed were in possession of large quantities of Old Horpey whiskey and that they had to be released. The men who were taken prisoners were freed in July of 1917. They had been freed because the authorities had decided that they would not be subject to further interrogation.
Hemp, in his account of the accident in Maryland, said of the men who were taken prisoner that they had been freed because the authorities had decided to continue on interrogating them in the same way in which they were freed. He then said that the men who were released by that decision had been locked up at Jefferson, MD. for an extended period of time. They had been locked up for several years and had been sent to Frederick, Md., to be interrogated on charges related to their crime. He added that his wife had taken him back to Baltimore to be interrogated because he had not returned to Maryland in his own person, but that the men who had been released by that decision had been locked up at Jefferson for an extended period of time. He had only been able to obtain a confession from a prisoner who had been detained at Jefferson for several days. The authorities in Maryland, after many days of deliberation and trial and many investigations, had concluded that the men who had been released had been released because the authorities had decided to continue on interrogating them in the same way in which they were freed. These men were sent to Maryland, and were found in Maryland in December of 1916. The men who were liberated were released because the authorities were convinced that they had been subject to further interrogation in the same way in which they were freed. When a man is released he will be informed as to all the charges against him. The men who were released were taken back to Maryland in November of 1918, and were in Maryland in December of the same year. They were held there for one month and taken back to Frederick, Md. and to Baltimore, then to Jefferson, MD., where they were released in March of 1919. During this time Hemp and his colleagues were held in Jefferson until June, 1920, when they were released on the assumption that they had committed the crime of treason. Their release from Jefferson, Maryland, was because the authorities had determined that they had not committed any crime in this district. They were transferred to Frederick, Maryland, and then to Baltimore, then to Jefferson, Maryland, where they were released in July of 1919.
Hemp was in Maryland for many months before he left the District, and his account shows that the government had a good deal of trouble in the vicinity of Jefferson, since there were rumors of robberies there and many of the watchmen had no idea of the location of the whiskey. But there is no report of any raids or seizures on Jefferson and",0.9802089059923036,0.2719675867308179,-0.7225412000766361,BLOOM-560M,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.7320368016038631,Negative Improvement,7 year 1922 type Article title http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/batch_dlc_bordercollie_ver02/data/sn84026749/0028076484A/1922030801/0007.pdf,,,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl

Three Government watchmen were tied up and threatened with death during a robbery of the Old Horpey Distillery in Frederick, MD. Early this morning, twenty armed bandits, traveling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, stole $84,000 worth of whiskey. Although an abandoned truck with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore pike, there are no leads on the whereabouts of the bandits. After preparation spanning several days, the bandits arrived at the distillery with fifteen breaking into the office to subdue the three watchmen. The aged whiskey, around 2,106 gallons, was loaded onto trucks and touring cars, taking the robbers until nearly 4 a.m. to complete the loading. The roads were reported clear by the motorcycle outposts, and the caravan left under the watchful eye of an armed man, threatening the watchmen if they tried to escape. Sheriff James C. Jones was notified, and the Washington Police Department placed a cordon around the city, watching every road that the bandits might use to transport the stolen whiskey into the District.

Tey appeared to have on plate knowledge of the location of the liquor, and lost no time opening the building. The trucks and touring cars were left on the streets as a back guard, and a guard was employed to protect them. About four-thirty in the afternoon, a car carrying the confiscated liquor was found at a business office in the city. The guards and the car driver were released and left for Washington. There was a call to the police for a search of the premises, and on finding the stolen liquor, a man in the car, whose name was not given, confessed that he was a local liquor agent. He said that when he arrived in Washington, a fellow agent, who had just arrived from Maryland, had asked him for the liquor. In a state of disbelief the agent said he had seen the man in his apartment, but that the man's friend had been drinking at a bar on the way. A man from the nearby town of Burmester was charged with assisting the robbery, and was arrested. He was convicted of assisting the robbery and was sentenced to six years in prison. The robbery was made by the man who was driving the car and the other man whose name was not given. The man who drove the car is also suspected of helping the robbers. There are no clues to the direction taken by the caravan or the location of the trailer. The bandits were described as being black, between the ages of twenty-three and thirty, standing about five feet four inches tall. Their attire was described as being black and wearing a yellow cowboy hat with a red, green, and blue striped raiment. Their appearance and surroundings were unknown. The thieves carried a number of handguns and pistols and a large load of ammo was found in the front seat of the car. The thieves are described as wearing black trousers and long coats, with black boots. They were driven by a man who had been with the car, while another man carried the weapon from the rear seat. A second car with three other men was also seen by the bandits in a nearby state of confusion. Two of the men were seen at the same time carrying the rifle and ammunition, while the third man carried a revolver. The stolen liquor was carried from a car driven by one of the thieves to Washington by another man, with the gun on his person. The two men were charged with aiding and abetting the robbery and were convicted of robbery. The burglary took place in the early morning hours. It is believed that the robbers entered the distillery and took the whiskey while the watchmen were asleep. The thieves were captured shortly before midnight on the Baltimore-Washington National Highway near Washington, Md. The liquor was purchased from the distillery, the money was collected, and the liquor was sent to Washington to be sold in the United States. The road from Maryland was closed for several hours, and on getting to Washington police sent two of the bandits over the pike to an isolated area where they were arrested. Two of the guards were shot and killed, and the fourth was wounded in the chest. They are expected to be prosecuted as a gang. A sheriff's deputy was injured in the shooting. In Washington, Maryland, Sheriff Jones gave orders for a search of all areas of the city, including every public road, public water system, sewer, road, and all other public and private roads into the District. His order states, ""The public shall not be allowed to approach this property until this office has been properly informed."" His order also says, ""If the people or any agents thereof should attempt to enter thedistillery and steal liquor and cash, there shall be the immediate arrest and prosecution of the offenders."" Police are in a panic and a sheriff's deputy was seriously injured in the shootout with the thieves. In the afternoon sheriff Jones was received at Baltimore by Chief Judge James H. White of the District Court of Appeals. Judge White was in attendance, and was informed that the sheriff was being relieved",0.9802089059923036,0.4768399729912221,-0.5135322990067117,OPT-350M,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.6742340914757987,Negative Improvement,7 year 1922 type Article title http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/batch_dlc_bordercollie_ver02/data/sn84026749/0028076484A/1922030801/0007.pdf,,,results-overproof-facebook-opt-350m.jsonl

The bandits got away in the direction of Frederick. Two Bodies Found. The sheriff sent out patrolmen and a detachment of infantry was dispatched to watch the road leading to Harpers Ferry and to take immediate steps for the protection of the town. One of the body was that of William Hart, who was badly wounded and who had been tied to a tree and left for dead. The other body was that of John Hemp, who, it is believed, fell from the roof of the building. When he did not show up a few hours later, the sheriff sent out a posse and found his body a few miles from Harpers Ferry. The watchmen described the bandit as about 5 feet 3 inches tall, of medium build and of a light complexion. He was about 35 years of age and was about to be married. His hair was thinning and he wore a full beard. The men did not speak English. The bandits had no firearms and carried no revolvers. All the time they were here, their movements were watched and the sheriff was told every detail. He and other officers of the law were stationed at all approaches to the city and a special police detail was engaged in securing evidence. The raiders were dressed in black and wore black masks over their faces. It is believed that they were well known to the local bootleggers. An Important Raid. The raid was an important one, as it marked the first time ever that an internal revenue agent had been taken for a bootlegger. The raiders were well prepared for the raid. A number of them had been here before and knew every nook and corner. The whiskey raid was the first successful raid ever made by the bootleggers in Frederick. They will probably raid again.

The caravan broke away from the train and then returned to Frederick, where the bandits proceeded to open the building, remove the barrels and load the whiskey into the trucks. They were in charge of the caravan for some distance and the caravan was then forced on by the authorities, until it was beyond reach. The police have made several arrests in connection with the affair. They believe one man, a well-known bandleader, had been engaged by the men who organized the caravan, but that he deserted the organization before the raid began.</s>",0.9802089059923036,0.1717976910390324,-0.8247335950644981,BLOOM-7.1B,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.7973918185098715,Negative Improvement,7 year 1922 type Article title http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/batch_dlc_bordercollie_ver02/data/sn84026749/0028076484A/1922030801/0007.pdf,,,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-7b1.jsonl

The watchmen soon realized that the man was a desperate man who wanted a last resort before he was killed. A few minutes later he came back carrying a box of gunpowder and told the watchmen that he wanted to burn the house. They resisted him vigorously, but were beaten to submission. When they finally surrendered to the authorities, the man threw the gunpowder into the kitchen and took possession of the safe and the key. Sheriff Jones was then told that it would be impossible to open the safe without the key. As the guards were brought out of the office, they were bound with heavy cords. One guard, a negro, who had worked in the office was released, and left in the hands of the watchmen, who told him to watch the door to keep out the bandits. Sheriff Jones was notified that the bandits had a machine gun, and were expected to be there a few minutes later. They were, however, never seen again. The watchmen were placed in an alley and then sent to the hospital. The hospital at which they were taken was a few miles away. They were taken out of the alley at once, and given a cold drink of water, to which they gave much attention. Later they were taken to the State jail, where they were allowed to sleep until it was judged necessary to place them in custody of the Washington authorities. In the meantime the district attorney at Washington was notified of the raid and was advised by the Federal marshal to send a police patrol on horseback to look for the caravan. The sheriff informed the Washington authorities that he was unable to reach the area until after the police patrol had returned to the city, so the district attorney at Washington called for the help of a cavalry detachment. The detachment was sent to the hospital where they stayed for several days to care for the injured, and then was sent back to Washington with the sheriff. The district attorney at Washington told Sheriff Jones that he had ordered a patrol of cavalry to proceed along the Baltimore and Washington Railroad, to look for the caravan. He advised him to wait until the patrol had returned. Sheriff Jones was then notified that the bandits were on horseback, and he was advised to make good his preparations to repel the raiders, and to get his cavalry to prepare to ride with the patrol. He was instructed to prepare for all eventualities, and to get his men to wear light steel shoes, heavy leather boots, and light saddle armor.
In the meantime the Federal marshal telephoned the Washington authorities to advise that the Federal troops were awaiting the arrival of the cavalry detachment. The cavalry was sent back to Washington at once. Sheriff Jones was then informed that the cavalry were awaiting orders to proceed against the bandits. It was a difficult case, since there was no definite information to guide the patrol. There was not a single witness. In addition, the cavalry had only one field hospital to deal with the casualties, and the Federal marshal advised Sheriff Jones that the men were all severely wounded. The cavalry remained at the hospital until the Federal marshal returned, and then started on the patrol, the detachment proceeding along the Baltimore and Washington Railroad. As they neared the town of Wilkesbarre, the cavalry was met by the bandits, who fled to a point where they could easily see the cavalry coming. Sheriff Jones was informed that the cavalry were well-armed and he was advised that the patrol was outnumbered by the bandits. The cavalry were then told to wait, and the bandits were seen to move on again. They continued on until the cavalry stopped the men and demanded their passports. The cavalry told them that they were on a search and that they were free to leave, but were advised to go to the nearest hotel and report there. After this warning, the cavalry retreated to their hotel in the city. The patrol went up to the hotel where they saw three men who told them that they were on a search for the bandits, and were in possession of an important piece of information about their movements. The cavalry, at that moment, was advised to halt, while the men were searched. During the search, the cavalry learned that the",0.9802089059923036,0.2971563981042654,-0.6968438092250933,BLOOM-3B,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.8019452776915138,Negative Improvement,7 year 1922 type Article title http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/batch_dlc_bordercollie_ver02/data/sn84026749/0028076484A/1922030801/0007.pdf,,,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-3b.jsonl

RAIDERS IN FREDERICK LAND HAUL OF $84,000 Watchman Bound and Gagged While Old Whiskey Is Loaded Into Autos. Travelling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, twenty armed bandits early today swooped down on the Old Horpey Distillery, near Frederick, Md., and made off with $84,000 worth of choice old whiskey, leaving three Government watchmen bound and gagged, under threat of instant death if they attempted to raise an alarm. % Beyond the fact that an abandoned truck, laden with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey, was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore pike, there is no clue to the direction taken by the caravan.

The distillery is thought to have been under close surveillance, day and night, by bandit spies, who learned every movement of the watchmen. Seven Autos In Raid. With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning.

Hemp, of Burkettaville, Md.: William Hart, of Baltimore, and John Moredock. of Baltimore. The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the ranges left more than two hours later. From fifty to sixty barrels of the aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons In all, was rolled from the building and leaded on the trucks and touring cars. A second, unidentified man was found in a truck and hauled away by two men who were on the other side of the building, who are reported to have kept an eye on the four other caravans. On the next morning, after an escort of forty miles of searchlight, they arrived at the Distillery in a van, which the four watchmen were riding in. On the next morning they saw that the distillery was still occupied and that there was a large crowd of men waiting for them. At this early hour, they were taken off by their motorbikes and taken to a storage area to be examined for evidence. Their bodies were subsequently disposed of by a warden and buried. After this day, and in the course of an inspection of the distillery, it is believed that the two watchmen were brought back to their places of rest and that the bodies recovered were indeed of the aged whiskey which they took, although this was not conclusive. The whiskey recovered was apparently more or less similar to those found in the old Whiskey Town of Chicago, but it was not until 1780. The discovery of the whiskey that day at a place unknown to the robbers did not result in their being murdered. The following day, the distillery was located by the following route, by way of the county, and in that place an independent, but respectable man, the Earl of Richmond, had set off to the Old Horpey Distillery in order to learn what to do in the matter. He had, at his request, received from the proprietors and operators of the Distillery Company (a company called 'C.R.P.' by his own nickname) of the distillery some whiskey which had been made on an island in North Africa. The proprietors, after their meeting with the estate agent of the distillery, and his wife, informed the owner that he would find it for him, and that it was as he had promised to use it, and that this was his plan for using it. He was then sent back to the distillery with his wife to see how they had obtained this whiskey and to inquire as to the proprietor's interest. A certain young man of the same name appeared in front of the proprietor and said that he had sent for this whiskey to him to obtain his business. His name was John B. Hampton. In a letter he had received from the owner of the Distillery, dated January 28, 1844, he asked for a ""salt and pepper"" of whiskey,",0.9802089059923036,0.5968268782081194,-0.3911227754006903,GPT-2,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.707448834742404,Negative Improvement,7 year 1922 type Article title http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/batch_dlc_bordercollie_ver02/data/sn84026749/0028076484A/1922030801/0007.pdf,,,results-overproof-gpt2.jsonl

Watchman Bound and Gagged While Old Whiskey Is Loaded Into Autos. 

Travelling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, twenty armed bandits early today swooped down on the Old Harper Distillery, near Frederick, Md., and made off with $84,000 worth of choice old whiskey, leaving three Government watchmen bound and gagged, under threat of instant death if they attempted to raise an alarm.

Beyond the fact that an abandoned truck, laden with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey, was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore pike, there is no clue to the direction taken by the caravan. It is thought the truck train may have broken apart and leaked.

The Washington Police Department upon being notified of the raid, threw a cordon about the city, and close watch was kept on every road which the stolen liquor might be brought into the District. The raid was evidently carried out after days of thorough preparation. The distillery is thought to have been under close surveillance, day and night, by bandit spies, who learned every movement of the watchmen.

Seven Autos In Raid.

With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning. While the motorcycle men scattered to guard every approach to the building, fifteen of the bandits broke into the office and overpowered the three watchmen- John R. Hemp, of Burkittsville, Md.; William Hart, of Baltimore, and John Moredock. of Baltimore. The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the raiders left more than two hours later.

From fifty to sixty barrels of the aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons in all, were rolled from the building and loaded on the trucks and touring cars. It took the bandits until nearly 4 o'clock to complete the loading of the caravan. Then the motorcycle outposts reported the roads clear. The watchmen were admonished against any attempt to escape and the caravan made off.

Telephone Lines Cut.

Hemp finally broke loose. He found the telephone lines had been cut and was forced to walk a long distance before he could spread the alarm. Sheriff James C. Jones was notified and telephoned the police in all nearby points to watch every road away from Frederick. In spite of the network, the bandits managed to slip through, and no clue as to the direction they took has been discovered, except for the abandoned truck at Jefferson. It is the belief of Sheriff Jones that the bandits were the same men who robbed the distillery of 200 cases of whiskey December 9 last. Much of the deer liquor was brought to Washington on that occasion and was sold by bootleggers at a high price.

Posed as Dry Agent.

The watchmen told Sheriff Jones that at 2 o'clock a man who represented himself as an internal revenue agent from Washington appeared at the door of the office and demanded admittance. As the door was opened, his confederates pushed their way in with drawn revolvers. The watchmen were threatened with death if they made any outcry or attempt to escape, and one shot was fired by way of warning.

Thank you for your help.

A:

The easiest way to do this is to use some regular expressions:

/(?<![^a-z]/)[\w][\w]/g
/(?<=[^a-z])\w/g

You should make the second one, since the first is not perfect and can match things like ""ab"", ""abc"", ""abcd"".</s>",1.0,0.1046931407942238,-0.8953068592057761,"The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the raigers left, more than two hours later.",The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the ranges left more than two hours later.,"The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the ranges left more than two hours later.

What is the proper form of the sentence?
You should use a verb in the present progressive tense. To say the things that happened ""until the ranges left"" is not a simple action. You have to say that they remained there until they left. The right verb is remained.</s>",0.9772727272727272,0.3190954773869346,-0.6734836975575552,"RAIDERS IN FREDER IC K LAND HAUL OF $84,000 Watchman Bound and Gagged While Old Whiskey Is Load eld Into Autos.

A few miles beyond Howard County the men stopped and, with the whiskey in hand, stole two wagons from a farm. They left the wagons empty and drove off. The following day the cars, carrying whiskey in barrels, left Washington and turned west on the Baltimore and Ohio road. They were driven into Howard County. The whiskey was left in barrels on the farms and was picked up by the bandits when they came to Howard County. The whiskey was sold at a high price on the black market and the proceeds were taken from the county and district treasury. The whiskey was sold by bootleggers at from $300 to $400 per gallon. The whiskey was stolen from the distillery at a cost of at least $84,000, and this crime is the second of a long line of burglaries of old distilleries. A number of cases of whiskey theft have occurred over the years In recent years. The Washington distillery was robbed of about 1,200 cases of whiskey and the Baltimore distillery. was robbed of about 600 cases of whiskey. The last crime, a burglary of the old distillery, was committed in December. The police of Howard County are confident in their investigation of the matter and will make a full report if requested.

He found the telephone lines had been cut and was forced to walk, a long distance before he could spread the alarm. Sheriff James C. Jones was called to check the news in front of his desk and called Hemp to report, but the guard he had to deal with left with his hands outstretched. The guard got over to him and took him to the top of the tower. He said: ""He was quite mad in here. I heard he was going to be there. He could not get up. We told him that he was going to have to get up and there was no escape from the tower. Then he got up. I asked to go to his room and he told me there were two things I could do."" He then told me that I should be allowed to keep the telephone lines. He was then placed in his room and he kept his phone to himself, then said: ""Well, I have been asked by some friends to stay at your house, and I would give you my word that you can take the phone. I can do whatever I want, but I am not going to let you down. I can send you a message if you ask for a man who will stay at your house, and then get up and go to bed."" The man took Hemp by partially to his chair. When he got up, he opened the door and let him know that he could not see him. Hemp said: ""What are you doing up here?"" The man said that he had a bad headache. Hemp said: ""Don't make that up. You have some problems with your headaches, and it's not going to come back."" At that time, Hemp found a man to help him, and he had a good time with the man. Hemp said: ""If you have a headache and you go into the store and get a bottle of water for me, I will go into the store and get the water for you. I have to tell you, that's all for the business. I'm sure you'd rather get a bottle of water than a bottle of whiskey."" The man told Hemp, ""Do you want a man here who can help me get a bottle of water, or I am going to send you to jail?"" Hemp said: ""Yes, and I have to do what I want with it."" After this, ""The first person I have to do, is get a doctor who has been given some medicine to get you to work.

The aged whiskey was stored in the underground cellars, and the bandits had no difficulty in locating it. The Old Horpey Distillery is considered one of the finest in Maryland and the bandits took only the aged whiskey. They destroyed the new liquor. The whiskey in the warehouse is not stored In kegs but in large tanks. The stolen liquor has been estimated at 30 years old.

Watchman Bound and Gagged While Old Whiskey is Loaded into Autos.

Traveling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, twenty armed bandits early today swooped down on the Old Horpey Distillery, near Frederick, Md., and made off with $84,000 worth of choice old whiskey, leaving three Government watchmen bound and gagged, under threat of instant death if they attempted to raise an alarm.

Beyond the fact that an abandoned truck, laden with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey, was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore pike, there is no clue to the direction taken by the caravan. It is thought the truck train may have broken a part and left the scene.

The Washington Police Department, upon being notified of the raid, threw a cordon around the city, and a close watch was kept on every road by which the stolen liquor might be brought into the District. The raid was evidently carried out after days of thorough preparation. The distillery is thought to have been under close surveillance, day and night, by bandit spies who learned every movement of the watchmen.

Seven Autos in Raid

With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning. While the motorcycle men scattered to guard every approach to the building, fifteen of the bandits broke into the office and overpowered the three watchmen - John R. Hemp of Burkittsville, Md.; William Hart of Baltimore, and John Moredock of Baltimore. The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged, and an armed man stood over them until the raiders left more than two hours later.

From fifty to sixty barrels of the aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons in all, were rolled from the building and loaded onto the trucks and touring cars. It took the bandits until nearly 4 o'clock to complete the loading of the caravan. Then the motorcycle outposts reported the roads clear. The watchmen were admonished against any attempt to escape, and the caravan made off.

The three men were helpless in their bonds. and could do nothing but hold their heads erect in shame. They were released only after the whiskey truck had passed the building. Bandits Masked. Sheriff Jones says there was no doubt the bandits were armed with automatic revolvers and machine guns. All were masked and wore long coats. They were all men who could ride. The stolen whiskey has been valued at $84,000. There is a reward of $10,000 offered by the distillery people for the capture of the bandits. The distillery Is a small one. operated by John J. Gorman. who owns a large plant at Hagerstown, Md. About 30 barrels of liquor a week are made there. The whiskey was in the process of maturing before bottling and was considered an aged brand. ""We are sorry to lose any amount of liquor. but the loss will not materially affect the distillery people,"" said Mr. Gorman, today. ""They are confident they can put a stop to the operations of the bandits, and, even if they cannot, the price paid by the whiskey peddlers for whiskey is too high to make the losses very serious. The distillery people will have more than they have had. There were about 100 barrels in the distillery, and that is a very small proportion of what was made."" The police say they have no clue to the direction taken by the motor-caravan. ""We can offer no hope whatever of capturing the bandits,"" said Sheriff Jones, ""as there were about 30 of them. They took all possible care in making their getaway and they have plenty of time before any of them can be taken. As long as they keep off the roads they will escape, and they will be difficult to overtake. If they keep to the hills and mountain roads, they will be hard to find. There is a possibility that they may break into the District from the south, and they might even slip into Virginia from Maryland. There is no point to which they can be hurried that will result in their being captured. All efforts will be made to capture them, and when they are captured, every effort will be made to get them before a jury, but there is very little likelihood that they can be overtaken. They are well known in the District, and they are sure to be armed with automatics and machine guns. I am very certain that if they had to pass through the District, they would be as cautious as possible, and they would probably find means of entering some town of the North Carolina mountains. There is no possibility of a mistake that they would not have taken every precaution. They are well known in the District and in all the northern cities."" Sheriff Jones, however, said he had no knowledge of a special watch being established at any of the mountain towns, as the only possibility would be in Virginia. ""I have no knowledge of any watch established, but if they are going to Virginia, they are going to pass by Virginia and North Carolina towns, and if any of these towns have been put on their guard I have not heard of it. In Virginia, at least, it is difficult to believe that any special watch will have been established. Sheriff Jones said that there was no way of knowing the location of the distillery. and the police were now searching the hills about Middletown for any suspicious signs of an auto or truck. The raid was planned with care. The motorcycle scouts were sent out on the two roads nearest the distillery at 3 a. m.

A week later నొప్పer and R. A. Ehrlich, of Baltimore. It was rumored that the bandits had taken out some of the liquor and had sold it for the bootlegger, but the real evidence is that they were still in possession of about 100 cases. The watchmen are quite skeptical that this was a fraud; they have known the bandits for many years. An Inquiry Into The Business of The Distillery, Baltimore. No evidence is to be had as to what the bandits intended to do with the rest of the whiskey, except that the man who was charged with the robbery of the distillery, an old acquaintance of the Bandits, was released.
The raid of the distillery at Jefferson, Md., had been followed by a much larger raid. The raid was held to take place during a winter vacation壽乡. The governor sent several deputies, some of whom were on the alert, and also an officer of the United States army. When the governor got on his radio, he said there was no evidence in the building of any weapons. The governor then asked the committee to look for clues, and the committee found that no evidence of any weapons was found. But the committee also noted that a shot of gunpowder had been thrown in the place, which was apparently a signal for an attack on the distillery. The committee found no evidence that anyone had intentionally shot or had fired shots at the distillery.
The governor then took possession of the distillery. He ordered all of the men to be arrested and, if they refused to obey the command, he would place the men in jail and put them under arrest for the rest of the summer. All of the workers were arrested and put on a watchlist to keep them under arrest. On Friday the 28th a riot was reported and, for the next few days, the distillery was closed. The bandits were not found and the Governor ordered them to be released in the morning of Friday, Dec. 20, and it was reported that no trace of the bandits remained. After a few days of surveillance the governor sent the governor's agents to search the building for more evidence of what might be taken out. They found nothing, except for a small amount of cinders, which they concluded had been thrown in. The governor sent a telegram to the Governor, telling him that there had been no report of a raid on the distilleryिएन.
There are no recorded reports of a raid on a distillery in New York or in Baltimore. This is not an unusual occurrence since there have been several reports that the distillery at Jefferson had been searched. In one of these reports, an examination of a box of whiskey found a rifle, two revolver bullets, and six barrels of whiskey. A second box of whiskey was examined, and also found that there were three shotgun shells and a gun. An examination of the distillery at Jefferson, Md., showed that there was no evidence of any weapons in the building, although the men were under the impression that the bandits were the same men who terkandungd the loaded trucks. A very similar raid of the distillery at Jefferson, Md., was reported on September 15th, 1904, and the raid was continued untilidus the following September, 1908. The raid took place about three miles from Jefferson. In September, 1908, the Governor and his Department of the Interior sent deputies, and an agent of the United States Army, to search the building. The Governor then requested all deliverymen in the distillery to come out and to give a report to the Governor. They showedثا to take their deliverances in a different manner than the previous time, since they appeared to have taken the loaded trucks and touring cars and placed them inside the distillery.
For the next twenty days several of the deliverers were arrested. On September 12th a report was issued by the Governor and the Department",0.9802089059923036,0.2534355179704017,-0.7414474440896464,BLOOM-560M,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.7950235595551378,Negative Improvement,7 year 1922 type Article title http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/batch_dlc_bordercollie_ver02/data/sn84026749/0028076484A/1922030801/0007.pdf,,,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl

New Bedford Offers to Send Guards to Prevent Thefts by John Thorndike President Fells of New Bedford What a few days ago were sighs of relief, concerning the lifting of marine sanctuary restrictions around New Bedford, have now become snarls of indignation because of the May 25, I9Jl, private circular issued by Charles S. Bliss, Commissioner of Navigation, certifying that the ports at New Bedford, N. Y, and New London as free from navigational dangers as all bays of refuge along the Atlantic coast. To authorities at New Bedford the great partiality displayed by this administration toward West Coast ports and shipping interests fully justifies such an accusation. So the City Council on May 31 took the initiative by offering to pay all the costs of adequately guarding the ocean entrances of New Bedford Bay during the ice season. This it was announced would be paid in charge of a Federal official and certain other material improvements there were recommended through the proper channels. No Federal Accusation. In a letter to the City Council, detailing the action taken by the Boston office of the American Shipmasters' Association, Mr. Green explains that ""in my opinion the request conforms with approved practice and makes no claim for service In the nature of a harbor improvement."" or any extension of Federal authority over the Potomac River.

Early today, twenty armed bandits, travelling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, swooped down on the Old Horpey Distillery near Frederick, Maryland. They made off with $84,000 worth of choice old whiskey, leaving three government watchmen bound and gagged with a threat of instant death if they raised an alarm. 

Beyond the fact that an abandoned truck, laden with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey, was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore pike, there is no clue to the direction taken by the caravan, although it is thought that the truck train may have broken down.

Upon notification of the raid, the Washington Police Department threw a cordon around the city and kept a close watch on every road that the stolen liquor might be brought into the District.

The raid was evidently carried out after days of thorough preparation. The distillery is thought to have been under close surveillance day and night by bandit spies who learned every movement of the watchmen.

With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning. While the motorcycle men scattered to guard every approach to the building, fifteen of the bandits broke into the office and overpowered the three watchmen – John R. Hemp of Burkettaville, MD, William Hart of Baltimore, and John Moredock of Baltimore. The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged, and an armed man stood over them until the raiders left more than two hours later. 

From fifty to sixty barrels of aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons in all, were rolled from the building and loaded onto the trucks and touring cars. It took the bandits until nearly 4 o'clock in the morning to complete the loading of the caravan. Then, the motorcycle outposts reported that the roads were clear. 

The watchmen were warned against any attempt to escape, and the caravan made off. Hemp finally broke loose. He found the telephone lines had been cut, and he was forced to walk a long distance before he could spread the alarm. Sheriff James C. Jones led the investigation.",0.9802089059923036,0.5382078064870808,-0.4509254066180595,GPT-3.5,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.2852291037933214,Negative Improvement,7 year 1922 type Article title http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/batch_dlc_bordercollie_ver02/data/sn84026749/0028076484A/1922030801/0007.pdf,,,results-overproof-gpt-3.5-turbo.jsonl

Tey appeared to have on plate knowledge of the location of the liquor, and lost no time opening the building. The trucks and touring cars were loaded into the back of the large motor cars and the four-wheel drive cars. They arrived in the distance and, after several hours, broke in. The bandits were tied with ropes and they were all pinned down by the guards. The guards were ordered to put down their guns and run as fast as possible to the nearest gun house. The guards were not allowed to look after the prisoners, and the men were then all tied to a cot. The four-wheel drive cars were driven in and it is thought they were hauled out and driven to the next gun house. The robbers were soon all in the car. They took three horses and four people. The two thieves- one was a local sheriff's horse. One was a police constable of Baltimore and the other was a local sheriff's horse. Sheriff Jones found it hard to resist, but in the ensuing hours he succeeded in bringing the four-wheel drive cars back from the woods, and on the following evening he had enough of them and the two thieves-one of them was a local sheriff's horse. He took them to the nearest gun house, but a day later he had to send them to the nearest gun house. In spite of the presence of two officers, one from the police department and the other from the sheriff's office, and the two of them on horseback, Sheriff Jones was able to beat back the bandits with his own horse and horseback. Two of the two of the thieves-one was a local sheriff's horse and the other a town police horse-took the two horses and left them with the bandits. They were led out to the nearest gun house, which was near the woods, where a guard was stationed. The carriages were driven down to the house where the guards were stationed. The robbers were driven out of the house and out of sight by the guard. The horses were all tied together, but with two or three broken harnesses the horses were driven down to the next gun house. A guard with a horse was stationed in front of the house. The guards watched them for a long time and they began to tire out and the horse was allowed to loose. The carriages were stopped and three of the two thieves who had broken the harness were removed and the men were placed under guard. A guard brought a horse to the house and the thieves rode off in one of the carriages. The carriages were driven through the woods in an east direction and they arrived at the town's gun house. The guards and horses were tied in two places, with one harness tied to a tie rope and the other tied to a rope wire. When they were all tied, the horses were led out of the house and the guard began to ride on the horses. The men were then led back through the woods to the house where the guards were stationed. The guards were watching the horses and when the men were brought in, one of them ran through the house and broke a chain through the horse's tail. The thieves, after several hours, were removed from the house and the horses were driven away. Sheriff Jones and the rest of the members of the Maryland police force who had been in the woods were ordered to be ready to escort the thieves to a gun house when they were finally caught. The two thieves and one of the carriages were led out to the next gun house, where the guards were stationed. When the guards had seen their horse and their horses were driven off, the two thieves got back in and drove off. The other two stole a horse and drove off. The guards were called to the scene and the two thieves were put on board the carriages and transported to the next gun house. A guard was ordered to put down his gun and watch out for the thieves and a guard was called to take charge of the horse.

The barrels were rolled into the trucks and the loaded cars started for the road leading from Baltimore. In the meantime, Hemp had been freed from his bonds and after getting into the truck started out on a run for the Baltimore- Washington road. He met two of the watchmen, who had succeeded in escaping, and the three were able to overtake the caravan. It was then too late. The three were unable to follow the bandits, and after a short chase they lost them. A police patrol on the Baltimore-Washington road soon reported that the trucks had passed the Baltimore turn-off for Washington, and the police were notified. The chase was hot for a while, but was abandoned after the trucks were reported in Baltimore. They were stopped near the city and turned over to city authorities. The barrels were taken to the sheriff's office. As soon as the distillery was notified the case was brought before the United States Commissioner for Prohibition. As it was already late and the commissioner was not to be reached, he was to be notified by telephone. In anticipation of this, telephone operators had been kept busy throughout the night, but as no call came, it was not until noon yesterday that the first intimation came that there was anything unusual about the affair. The stolen whiskey was valued at $42.00 a barrel, and was aged two years. About 40 Bodies. The raid netted about 40 bodies, among them those of men, women and children. About 70 people were arrested, among them a negro, and the raid was the work of a single band of men. The raiders were believed to have been men with large experience and many friends. They are thought to have been acting under orders of some person at Washington. The distillery is the property of the J. H. Horpey Co. of Baltimore. It is one of the largest in Maryland.

The last raid in Frederick was committed December 9, on a distillery belonging to the J. H. Horpey Co. It was done in an amateurish manner and the Government authorities, on learning of it, at once began investigation. The first evidence obtained indicated that a special force was engaged in the work. This was soon confirmed by a raid on a distillery belonging to John C. and E. H. Smith. On the 9th they were both arrested, but later released. A few weeks ago there was a raid on a distillery owned by E. J. Rau. One man was arrested and later released. The raiders appear to have a peculiar system of communication. Their leader may be in jail. Others of the band may be trying to avoid arrest. Another band may be in hiding. They may be waiting to strike again. The Horpey Distillery. In October, during the past winter, a raid was made on another distillery belonging to Horpey. About 30 men were employed in the distillery, and the men were armed with revolvers. All the liquor, which was worth about $40,000 was seized. It was believed that the raiders, who were well armed and had much knowledge of the distillery, had stolen some of the old whiskey recently purchased by the Government for use on the Northern Pacific Railway.

All of the watchmen were known to one and another of the bandits and it was believed that they would not try to escape. As it turned out, no attempt at escape was made, and it seems possible the bandits did the raid from a plan of concealment.

RAIDERS IN FREDERICK LAND

  HAUL OF $84,000

  Watchman Bound and Gagged While Old Whiskey Is Loaded Into Autos.

  Travelling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, twenty
  armed bandits early today swooped down on the Old Horpey Distillery,
  near Frederick, Md., and made off with $84,000 worth of choice old
  whiskey, leaving three Government watchmen bound and gagged, under
  threat of instant death if they attempted to raise an alarm.

  Baltimore, and John Moredock. of Baltimore. The three watchmen were
  tightly bound and gagged and an armed man stood over them until the
  ranges left more than two hours later.

Why not just use one of the replacements for spare described above? The corrected text does use another form of material, gagged, to replace earwigged, so the process of replacement is established well. All that is not obvious is the rule by which to decide that it is allowed to replace watchmen with the singular watchman. That will come in Historical Limitations, subsection of Grammatical Limitations, see Historical Limitations.

Correct readings in full detail are a detailed commentary on correct usage using correct markup -- if you look closely.

As we said at the beginning, you can sort out the main issues for yourself for now --it is not recommended to rely on any single reference example without a very careful examination of all possible inconsistencies. We have carefully removed any inconsistencies. Now, examine the history of the E/ L sequence and its relationship to the rule given in Historical Limitations.

The first paragraph consists of reading-level jargon repeated in a way that appears to make it more complicated than it is. Only two differences need to be discussed: first, Bezier curves take the place of bÃ¤zyr curves; second, cusp angles take the place of Ãµp angles. We are not particularly concerned with the content here since it is outside the scope of this document, but the sequencing of content is important as it is to attribution and other document structure. Both contain multiple statements of the same thing. Further, the structure does not make it easy to infer the beginning of or end of a sentence. That particular egregious transgression is not routinely repeated in correct literature. Practice headings start a new line (sometimes a new paragraph) at their beginnings. So, this is not for this document. Other violations of the rules contained here are benign but confusing to those not familiar With them, e.g. What is the first line of the second paragraph? The contents of the paragraphs up to the heading History really belong to something else -- it is illustrative when it belongs and other when it belongs, but there is no coherent organization within the paragraph with respect to this document. Additionally, there are multiple fragment sentences with the same subject. While this is not prohibited, it should not be done in a sequence of more than one sentence. These problems, particularly the fragment sentences, tell us that this has not been published, and is provided as a raw history.

The next three paragraphs need their content sorted, but the sequencing is formal. They form the body of the document, though the first two are not enabled and will not be used. The content of the two heading paragraphs is from the author, but cannot now be seen to have been typed by the author, or if so, strongly edited by someone else, so the first paragraph will not be used, as it too has internal sequencing problems. And now I think that it is impossible to descibe the author without getting into libel so that is for another document, such as the one about credit and grants of rights. The first paragraph does have an issue: the generic he is a pronoun, but can be read to implicitly mean publication or some other institutional or organized activity. This is where, really, authors and contributors need to be explicit about the intended reading. The second paragraph strongly suggests that the intent of the document is only to detail a letter to the Joneses help us to figure out which of them donated the underwear, etc.

The paragraphs by the alleged author are indicated as having been converted. To what? The original Webmasters forbid my finding out.

Travelling with a motor caravan and armed motorcycle scouts, twenty armed bandits swooped down on the Old Horpey Distillery near Frederick, Maryland, early today. They made off with $84,000 worth of choice old whiskey and left three government watchmen bound and gagged under threat of instant death if they tried to raise an alarm. 

Beyond the fact that an abandoned truck laden with seventeen barrels of the stolen whiskey was found eight miles from Frederick on the Baltimore Pike, there is no clue to the direction the caravan took. It is thought the truck train may have broken down. The Washington Police Department, upon receiving notification of the raid, threw a cordon about the city, and a close watch was kept on every road that the stolen liquor might be brought into the district. 

The raid was evidently carried out after days of thorough preparation. The distillery is thought to have been under close surveillance, day and night, by bandit spies who learned every movement of the watchmen.

With motorcycles far to the front and following as a rear guard, the twenty bandits, with three big automobile trucks and four touring cars, drove up to the distillery at 2 o'clock this morning. While the motorcycle men scattered to guard every approach to the building, fifteen of the bandits broke into the office and overpowered the three watchmen: John R. Hemp of Burkettaville, Maryland; William Hart of Baltimore; and John Moredock of Baltimore. The three watchmen were tightly bound and gagged, and an armed man stood over them until the raiders left more than two hours later. Around fifty to sixty barrels of aged whiskey, approximately 2,106 gallons in all, were rolled from the building and loaded onto the trucks and touring cars. It took the bandits until nearly 4 o'clock to complete the loading of the caravan. Then the motorcycle outposts reported the roads clear. The watchmen were admonished against any attempt to escape, and the caravan made off.

FREDERICK, Md. — Sheriff James C. Jones, of the City of Frederick, and members of the Frederick Police Department on Friday morning, observed that the owners of an old liquor building were trying to escape from the city by running down the street, a distance of about two miles, in a manner that could only be described as a ""dismal"" attempt.
The sheriff also informed the people of the crime, who then hurried in to the offices. The deputies, with the aid of horse-drawn and carriages, and the troopers, were stationed at the door to catch the robbers, who escaped by running along the street and out of sight.
They made some attempts to break in through the front windows of the building, but were met with the same obstacle as had been done in the case of the robbery, which was accomplished by the horse-drawn vehicle in the street.
The sheriff told the police that he found the truck tracks and that the bandit men were behind them, but that there were no other signs of the bandits. The robbers were arrested and the property taken into the custody of the Sheriff's Department.

The watchmen told Sheriff Jones that at 2 o'clock a man who represented himself as an internal revenue agent from Washington appeared at the door of the office and demanded admittance. As the door was opened, his confederates pushed their way- in with drawn revolvers. The watchmen were threatened with death If they made any outcry or attempt to escape and one shot was fired by way of warning. Then the watchmen were backed against the wall, disarmed, and tied hand and foot with heavy cords. Handkerchief were stuffed into their mouths and they were bound With the guards tied and aged, the bandits worked quickly.

It was up to the Minister, who could regulate or prohibit the conduct of any Sunday entertainment if, in his opinion, it offended against good behaviour. MINISTER'S RIGHT Mr. Bagot said Mr. Evatt had submitted for a review of all the cases he had been brought before before the Courts in relation to this particular case. He then asked for the Minister's comments on the matters before the Court on that subject. Mr. Bagot said there were a number of questions that needed to be answered and he wanted to know the view of the Chief Secretary on this matter. The Chief Secretary said the question was: are you sure that the two men are not in breach of section 19 of the N.S.W. Section 19 is to be read in relation to this case and where did it come from that was written that it had to be read on this particular basis? Is it clear that, if not, a matter of the court to grant any of the rulings that are made in the matter, then where did the question come from? What does that leave in the minds of the Court? Mr. Bagot said the judge in this case was not a judge. Mr. Bagot said that he considered that it was in the public interest for the Chief Secretary to do something. Mr. Bagot said that the Minister could do something. The Chief Secretary then said he was going to have the hearing adjourned as well as the decision taken on that matter. The Minister said he would like to make that request within ten minutes. The Chief Secretary said he would have to make his decision. Mr. Bagot said he would not like to make the decision. Mr. Bagot said he would like the decision to be taken by the Chief Secretary before he could make his decision on the matter. The Chief Secretary said that if there were any decisions that have not been made, and it has been determined by the court that the Minister has made them, that the matter should be adjourned. Mr. Bagot said he was not going to make a decision that was that his. Mr. Bagot said that the matter could not be adjourned until after the hearing adjourned. Mr. Bagot said that if there were any decisions that have not been made then he would like to make a decision. The Chief Secretary said he would like to make the decision on the matter as the hearing was adjourned. Mr. Bagot said he would like to make that decision within ten minutes.

The Australian Institute of Architects has developed the Australian Building Code in response to an increasing demand for high-quality design solutions. The Code provides an extensive set of building standards for a wide range of building applications and ensures that architects and other relevant agencies comply with them.

These standards are currently applied nationally through the Australian Building Inspection Council, which has the sole authority to investigate all building codes and ensure that the standards are properly enforced.

K.C. is to be elevated to the Bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as a Justice of the Peace. There are at least two reasons why the K.C. should not be called upon to perform any- functions as Judge Clive: (1) A Justitio has never been known to ""carry on."" (2) Any honest man holding the position of Justitio should have made better use of his classical education at Sydney University. There are, of course, dozens of competent lawyers in New South Wales who should be given g Wnl when in such circumstances the bench beckets them. Why not, for instance, call on Mr. Reginald Sleep or Mr. Arnold Withy? There is, of course, something about a crown of another that goes to one's head as well as to one's pocket. But the right preparation for any task at the front-line of the Bench, including an appointment as Judge Clive, consists of getting some wartime training with the arms of the battlefield. If you hope to be 'rewarded] with a Justice of the Peace Judgeship in the Army, you begin your career as a barrister where some others begin theirs: in the trenches. In this way we learn the value of practice in Court; and we learn to value it considerably more. Would Mr. Evatt: become a valuable instrument 'in the prosecution of our civil izers ,he practises with some of the less brutal means of inducing a man to take action voluntarily? And can the lady from Empire News (p. 15) get Mr. Evatt to intervene in her case? The lady wants the Department of Public Works to provide proper drying and airing space for babies' ""powder"" nappies, so that the said babies' backs may be protected from diaper- rash. If Mr. Evatt is convinced that this disorder is ""a little thing"" for an old B.A. to take it on, why not advise on such matters as he values defending Const. Farrer Crabtree?

MONDAY The Australian and Sydney Newspapers have published the following statement by Mr. C. Begg, solicitor for the defendants: - It has been suggested that the Government should intervene in this particular case to prevent the prosecution of the motion pictures by the Motion Picture Exhibitors Association. It is not the position of the Government to intervene in this particular case, any more than it is to interfere in any other case. I think it is entirely proper that the prosecution should go on. The case has been made that the films were screened on Sunday. That is a matter of fact which can be proved. It was not a charge which was made to the police by anybody except a member of the Motion Picture Exhibitors Association. The police, if they had been instructed, would have taken action. The police, for the purpose of the prosecution, have not made any complaint and, as such, they do not have any jurisdiction. There is no allegation in the charges that any person who is not a member of the Motion Picture Exhibitors Association was charged with entering the theatres on Sunday. The charge in the charges is that the films were screened. It is not the Government's policy to prevent any particular class of persons, whether they be members of any of the associations or not, from seeing the films. The case has been made that this prosecution is in the interests of the people. I say that the case is not in the interests of the people. The film shows are a novelty. They are not very popular. The Sunday screenings are very unpopular, even though the Government, by a decision of its Ministers, has given permission for the screenings. The Sunday screenings would be prevented if the Government intervened to interfere with the prosecution. That is the policy of the Government. If that policy is carried out, I am not sure that the motion pictures, even though the court permits the screenings, will continue to be shown. It is not the policy of the Government to interfere with the presentation of the films. The Australian and Sydney Newspapers have also published the following statement by Mr. S. M. Beavers: - The Minister of the Crown has the power under the Theatres and Public Halls Act to prohibit the exhibition of certain films on certain days and times. He has not acted in this case in the manner in which the Motion Picture Exhibitors Association wishes. The Minister has decided not to proceed with the prosecution. The Government is not interested in the motion picture exhibition. It does not consider that any interference will advance public morality. The Government does not interfere in any case where public morality is involved. The Government is not interested in the Sunday screenings of the motion pictures. The Government's policy is that any person may see the motion pictures on Sunday as he may see them on any other day. Mr. H. F. Crabtree, private secretary to the Minister of the Crown, gave evidence yesterday before the Criminal and Traffic Court on the first day of the prosecution of two men by Mr. William Robert Harrop, the",0.9827586206896552,0.4423248350864682,-0.5499150800874534,OPT-6.7B,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,80-99%,-0.6972703921055307,Negative Improvement,18235000 year 1951 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 18235000,,,results-overproof-facebook-opt-6.7b.jsonl

Mr. Bradley (for Harrop) asked the Court if they could send the documents by registered post. Mr. J. W. Smythe replied that the documents could be forwarded to the Court.

The defence was entitled to say whether a document was or was not of a private or confidential nature, whether it had or had not been published or how many copies were produced. The Court, if it found the document was of a confidential nature, should say so. Mr. Smythe said that it would be desirable to allow the defence time to produce their evidence. As an example, the defence might wish to argue for the production of some letters, photographs, and other documents that had been taken from the theatre. It would be desirable to have the defence allow the witnesses a certain number of minutes to explain the nature and purpose of the documents that were to be produced. It would also be desirable to give the defence some time to produce their evidence. The defence should allow the witness some time to explain the nature and purpose of the documents that they wished to produce.

August 19. r Asking for leave to appear for Mr. Evatt, Mr. Bagot said yesterday that the Minister, in his discretion, had approved the Sunday screenings and it was not a matter for the Court to grant such approval. It was up to the Minister, who could regulate or prohibit the conduct of any Sunday entertainment if, in his opinion, it offended against good behaviour. MINISTER'S RIGHT Mr. Bagot said Mr. Evatt had submitted for a review of all the cases he had been brought before before the Courts in relation to this particular case. He then asked for the Minister's comments on the matters before the Court on that subject. Mr. Bagot said there were a number of questions that needed to be answered and he wanted to know the view of the Chief Secretary on this matter. The Chief Secretary said the question was: are you sure that the two men are not in breach of section 19 of the N.S.W. Section 19 is to be read in relation to this case and where did it come from that was written that it had to be read on this particular basis? Is it clear that, if not, a matter of the court to grant any of the rulings that are made in the matter, then where did the question come from? What does that leave in the minds of the Court? Mr. Bagot said the judge in this case was not a judge. Mr. Bagot said that he considered that it was in the public interest for the Chief Secretary to do something. Mr. Bagot said that the Minister could do something. The Chief Secretary then said he was going to have the hearing adjourned as well as the decision taken on that matter. The Minister said he would like to make that request within ten minutes. The Chief Secretary said he would have to make his decision. Mr. Bagot said he would not like to make the decision. Mr. Bagot said he would like the decision to be taken by the Chief Secretary before he could make his decision on the matter. The Chief Secretary said that if there were any decisions that have not been made, and it has been determined by the court that the Minister has made them, that the matter should be adjourned. Mr. Bagot said he was not going to make a decision that was that his. Mr. Bagot said that the matter could not be adjourned until after the hearing adjourned. Mr. Bagot said that if there were any decisions that have not been made then he would like to make a decision. The Chief Secretary said he would like to make the decision on the matter as the hearing was adjourned. Mr. Bagot said he would like to make that decision within ten minutes. The Chief Secretary said that if the matter was not adjourned then he would like to make the decision. The Chief Secretary said that if he had decided to make the decision to make the decision on the matter, he would do so",0.9827586206896552,0.5306312601910086,-0.4600594194547632,GPT-2,prompt_complex_02,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,80-99%,-0.6273508011932866,Negative Improvement,18235000 year 1951 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 18235000,,,results-overproof-gpt2.jsonl

He said that Mr. Beavers had informed him that the film would be released during the week of September, 1908, and that the film had not yet been produced, but he was not assured that it would be released in the summer of the same year. Mr. Evatt said that Mr. Beavers is not permitted to watch it until Mr. Harrop can produce a copy of the film. Mr. Bagot said that Mr. Beavers is also to be permitted to watch the film in its original English language, which Mr. Bagot is requesting be made. Mr. Harrop (as Mr. Beavers) and Mr. Cook were present at the trial. Mr. Bagot had suggested that Mr. Cook and Mr. Cook's assistant, N.S.W.A., be called for to appear. The judge was satisfied with the attendance of Mr. Cook. Mr. Harrop and Mr. Cook were present at the trial. Mr. Bagot said that Mr. Cook's trial, if successful, may place Mr. Harrop in the power of enforcing the laws of the Crown. Mr. Harrop said that he would not be permitted to appear. Mr. Bagot said that he was requested to appear because his lawyer, Mr. Smythe, was at that time acting on behalf of Mr. Cook, who had been acquitted on behalf of the Attorney-General. Mr. Smythe said that Mr. Bagot would be compelled to appear if the Attorney-General ordered him. Mr. Smythe said that Mr. Bagot was entitled to take oath if he requested the Court. Mr. Bagot said that he had been requested by the Crown to appear. Mr. Bagot said that the Crown was not required to do so if it could not procure a copy of the film and that it was sufficient to make the film available for viewing. Mr. Bagot said that he had been requested to appear on the grounds that he would be forced to appear on a film which had been produced by an amateur. Mr. Smythe said that if the Crown were to grant Mr. Bagot the privilege of acting as a witness on a film which was produced by an amateur, it would need to agree to this. Mr. Smythe said that Mr. Bagot should be brought before the Court with a copy of the film produced by an amateur. Mr. Smythe said that the Court had not been satisfied with the appearance of Mr. Cook, who had failed to be found guilty by the Crown. Mr. Bagot said that the Court should have heard the other jurors and heard the defence. Mr. Smythe said that Mr. Bagot, if convicted, would be placed in the power of enforcing the laws of the Crown. Mr. Bagot said that the Crown was not required to require that Mr. Cook be admitted to appear if it could not procure a copy of the film and that it was sufficient to make the film available for viewing.

The prosecutions were laid under the Theatres and Public Halls Act, 1908-1946. Mr. Harrop is also honorary business manager of the Motion Picture Exhibitors Association. 

NEW SUMMONSES 
The two men are accused of contravening Section 19 of the N.S.W. Theatres and Public Halls Act by screening films at the King's Cross Theatrette on Sunday, August 12, for which an admission charge was made. Further summonses have been laid against Hilda Blanche Hattam, the Australian Biograph Company Pty Ltd., and the Premier Theatre (Surry Hills) Pty. Ltd. for screening films on Sunday, August 19. 

Asking for leave to appear for Mr. Evatt, Mr. Bagot said yesterday that the Minister, in his discretion, had approved the Sunday screenings and it was not a matter for the Court to grant such approval. It was up to the Minister, who could regulate or prohibit the conduct of any Sunday entertainment if, in his opinion, it offended against good behaviour. 

MINISTER'S RIGHT 
Mr. C. Begg (for Scheinwald) said Mr. Harrop was asking the Court to sit in judgment on a Minister of the Crown. He said: ""The Minister is not responsible to this Court. He is responsible to the Crown and Parliament. It is not for the Court to interfere. The Minister is in a most unusual position under the Act. He has the sole right to say whether a theatre or a public house is in fact a theatre or a public house.""

The following is a short extract of a letter sent to Mr. Bagot, on July 6, 1916, by Mr. Jack Taylor, president of the American Film and Dramatic Club, of which Mr. Bagot is the secretary and chairman. The following is also a brief report of the proceedings of the American Film and Dramatic Club, of which Mr. Bagot is secretary and chairman, held at the Central Court in Sydney on July 2, 1916: 1. Mr. D. A. D. Evatt, the solicitor for Mr. Evatt, was admitted into the Court, and called for his evidence, but declined to give evidence. 2. The prosecuting officer was then admitted, and called for his evidence. 3. Mr. Bagot gave an extract from his statement of the charges made by the solicitor for Mr. Evatt. 4. The plaintiff and defendant, Mr. Evatt and Mr. Jack Taylor, respectively, agreed that they were not in a position to give a full statement, and, for that reason, agreed to adhere to the rule previously agreed upon, according to which, in future, the evidence would be to be taken from the plaintiff, and the evidence from the defendant. 5. The plaintiff and the defendant then took their seats. 6. It was observed that no formality would have been required by either of them to give their statements in this court. 7. Mr. Bagot observed that the plaintiff had stated, in the statement given in the statement of the charges made by the solicitor for Mr. Evatt, that the films were given in the form of Sunday evening programmes. Mr. Bagot stated that the fact that there were films of the type to which he referred was not proved. 8. Mr. Bagot was then ordered to call a jury. 9. Mr. J. C. H. M. T. Bradley, Mr. W. H. J. Smythe, and Mr. C. A. S. F. M. W. H. Maguire, who were in the jury box, and who were present at the moment, were ordered to return a verdict of not guilty. Mr. Bradley was the first of the jury to take his seat, and to enter his verdict. He returned: ""We do not find that any person guilty of an offence."" Mr. Bradley then proceeded to enter a second verdict, to the effect that no person had been convicted. Mr. Maguire was the second of the jury to take his seat, and to enter his verdict. He returned: ""The evidence is clear. The film is a play, and there is nothing more in the case."" The court adjourned until November 2, when a further sitting will be held. Mr. T. C.

Begg, Alexander Hamilton (Hamish), first Baron Haversham (1889–1970)
https://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A170145b.htm
Hamish Begg, the younger son of Alexander Begg and Louisa (née MacKenzie), was born on 24 May 1889 at Brompton, Melbourne, and educated at Scotch College. In 1905, at the age of 16, he was apprenticed to the law firm of Russell & Co. He was admitted as a solicitor on 23 September 1909 and was called to the bar on 10 December 1911. In March 1913 he was appointed Crown prosecutor for South Australia and moved to Adelaide, later becoming Queen's Council on 12 December 1923. On 18 January 1927 he resigned from the Crown prosecutorship to concentrate on his legal practice. In 1930 he was elected a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, representing the electoral district of East Torrens, and served until 1944. On 18 December 1930 he was appointed to the South Australian cabinet as attorney-general and minister for justice. He remained in these portfolios until the formation of the Labor government in 1933, when he returned to the Legislative Council.
A member of the Liberal Party, he entered federal parliament at the 1934 election as member for East Sydney, defeating the incumbent Joseph Cook by a slender margin of five votes. With the assistance of the United Australia Party he was appointed treasurer in Stanley Bruce's ministry on 19 April 1934, becoming minister for defence on 20 November of that year, following the death of Alexander Hore-Ruthven. In 1937 he became minister for the Army and for defence forces. When the Bruce ministry was reconstructed in October 1937 he resumed his portfolio of defence forces, which he retained until the election of the Labor Party in 1941.
Apart from a brief interlude (April 1935 to December 1937) when he had also held the portfolios of minister for aviation, minister for external affairs and minister for post-war organisation, and apart from a",0.9827586206896552,0.2331504702194357,-0.7627591706539075,LLAMA-7B,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,80-99%,-0.7797946615629311,Negative Improvement,18235000 year 1951 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 18235000,,,results-overproof-decapoda-research-llama-7b-hf.jsonl

Theatres and Public Halls Act, 1908-46, were not applicable to the Court because they were contained in the National Act. This was because the Minister was in an exceptional position when it was asked to make an amnesty and the Act was not intended to apply to the Minister as well. Mr. Wharton pointed out that Mr. Harrop was in a very exceptional position because of the case in hand. This was an extraordinary situation. He also pointed out that the Act was not intended to apply to the Director of National Theatres and Public Halls.Style: A.A.C.F.D.T.H.W.T",0.9827586206896552,0.2515673981191222,-0.7440191387559808,BLOOM-560M,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,80-99%,-0.7755620247479391,Negative Improvement,18235000 year 1951 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 18235000,,,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl

Mr. Alan Bagot asked Mr. Beavers for permission to intervene on behalf of the Chief Secretary's Department He said the whole question hinged on the discretion of the Minister.

It was in view of these circumstances that Mr. Beavers submitted a motion to the Court to allow his representative to intervene on behalf of the Chief Secretary's Department, but the Court declined to hear this motion. It was accordingly stated by Mr. Beavers that, if a Minister could refuse to intervene on behalf of his Department, then he was in no position to intervene on behalf of the Crown. Mr. Beavers was accordingly informed that, if he did not accede to his request for leave to intervene, he would be obliged to resign as Minister of the Crown.
It is clear from the amended text, therefore, that, on the one hand, there is a need for permission to intervene in the proceedings of the Court, and, on the other hand, there is a need for a request for leave to intervene from the Minister. The Court would be compelled to grant the request in order to permit the Minister to intervene on behalf of the Crown. It is clear that the request would not have been granted if the Minister had declined to take any action.</s>",0.9827586206896552,0.3557993730407524,-0.6379585326953747,BLOOM-560M,prompt_complex_01,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,80-99%,-0.7371278097139512,Negative Improvement,18235000 year 1951 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 18235000,,,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl

I don't know the OCR program, but I guess it is a bit of a challenge. I would suggest to use the following approach:

Use the manual transcription from the linked document
Repeat steps 2-5 for the OCR result, looking for the same errors.

If that doesn't work, it's likely that the OCR is not doing a good job.
If the errors are very small, then you could use the manual transcription as a guide and make a few corrections",1.0,0.0382022471910112,-0.9617977528089888,"Rls^ftssTTV-T» V.

The plaintiff in the above cases has been discharged by this Court. The parties plead that they are perfectly aware that the defendant is not an Australian resident, and that it is not the intent of this Court to sanction the practice of the plaintiffs, which they are aware have been going on with the defendant since June last, and which, after the trial, they intend to continue. The defendant has made a number of applications, both by letter and personally, to the Court, for the plaintiffs to be reinstated on the ground that they were not permitted to practise the law in Australia in accordance with the Act of 1907, and on the basis of these applications he has obtained a judicial decree. The plaintiffs have in the meantime, before the Court, shown a written application to this Court for reinstatement, which they say has been accepted as a genuine application by the Court, that their practice of the law in Australia is in accordance with the law of Australia, and that they can show that they are Australian residents, although they are not Australian nationals. The parties agree that it is not the intent of this Court to sanction the practice of the plaintiffs. We cannot enter into the application. We are of the opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to practise their profession, and we are satisfied that there is no question that the plaintiffs practise the law in accordance with the law of Australia. They were able to procure, at a small expense, the services of an Australian lawyer, who has been practising in Australia for some time, but who is no longer a resident of Australia. We are of the opinion that it is not the intent of this Court to sanction the practice of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have in the meantime, before the Court, shown a written application to this Court for reinstatement, which they say has been accepted as a genuine application by the Court. We are of the opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to practise their profession, and we are satisfied that there is no question that the plaintiffs practise the law in accordance with the law of Australia.

The following passage is intended to be printed in blue:
THOUGH
the evidence is only in the words of the witnesses and no evidence of their demeanour was elicited, the evidence is sufficient to show that, between the 1st and the 3rd of March 1879, defendant (Dr Moir) was guilty of the following offences:
1. He caused goods sold to defendant (the plaintiff) to be sold again by defendant (Dr Moir).
2. He caused defendant (Dr Moir) to be employed to deliver the goods to the defendant (the plaintiff).
3. He caused defendant (Dr Moir) to sell the goods at a price which defendant (the plaintiff) was not required to pay.
It was clear that the defendant (Dr Moir) had a desire to defraud defendant (the plaintiff). The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that the goods sold by the defendant (Dr Moir) to defendant (the plaintiff) were for defendant (the plaintiff)'s account. The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that defendant (the plaintiff) was entitled to receive goods at the price agreed upon. The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that defendant (the plaintiff) had not paid defendant (Dr Moir) for the goods. It appears that the defendant (Dr Moir) intended to defraud defendant (the plaintiff). The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that the goods would not be delivered at the price agreed upon unless defendant (the plaintiff) paid defendant (Dr Moir). It is not necessary to prove that defendant (Dr Moir) had a desire to defraud defendant (the plaintiff) in order to convict defendant (Dr Moir) of the offence of causing defendant (the plaintiff) to be employed to deliver the goods to defendant (the plaintiff). The evidence is sufficient to show that defendant (Dr Moir) had the intention to defraud defendant (the plaintiff). The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that defendant (the plaintiff) would not receive the goods unless he paid defendant (Dr Moir). The defendant (Dr Moir) knew that he could avoid giving the plaintiff goods at the price agreed upon by giving defendant (the plaintiff) goods for which defendant (Dr Moir) was not required to pay. The evidence is sufficient to show that defendant (Dr Moir) had the intention to defraud defendant (the plaintiff). The evidence is sufficient to show that defendant (Dr Moir) knew that defendant (the plaintiff) would not receive the goods unless he paid defendant (Dr Moir).

CONCERTS IN THE PRESENT JURISDICTION
The Court decided the cases against Mr. P S Darnell, of Hartnell, and Mr. H. H.

The Court concluded by the payment of an interest on the sum paid for the sale of coal for the purchase of condit oil. The Company was not bound to pay the sum to Mr. Johnson; he was therefore compensated. The Company was then liable for £25,000, to the plaintiff for the loss incurred.</s>",0.9466666666666668,0.3095238095238095,-0.6730382293762576,BLOOM-560M,prompt_basic_01,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.8684522940753329,Negative Improvement,13922000 year 1893 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 13922000,,,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-560m.jsonl

He was an officer of the Commonwealth of Australia in the employ of the United States government, and by no means a wealthy man. His business was to obtain coal and timber, as well as to supply food, and to give to the United States at present, and to continue for a period of several years, a service of £5 6s 7d per annum. His business was limited to obtaining timber, timber, and timber, but his possessions were not substantial enough to afford him much security. There was no interest in his estates for more than twenty years; and he was not able to make his monthly repayments. Mr. Haines, as an officer of the United States government, made a general payment of £20,000 to the United States, but he only had the money as a deposit. This interest of the United States was then repayed. He was no more prosperous than when he left the United States, but his income was very poor, and he was unable to support himself for a long time. He was forced, upon losing his income, to take the action for £20,000, a sum which he was unable to pay. Mr. Haines then took a very large sum of money from Mr. Smith, and paid it to Mr. Smith's friend at the time Mr. Smith, as the lawyer, was called to give evidence at Mr. Smith's trial. This payment of money was to be paid to Mr. Smith, on a monthly basis, for the remaining period of the loan. Mr. Smith, as the lawyer, was charged with being the owner of the land on which the land was situated. Mr. Smith had an interest in this land, and in his contract with Mr. Haines he paid him £25 6s. 6d per annum for the remainder of the loan. Mr. Haines then took a large sum of money from Mr. Smith, and paid it to Mr. Smith's friend at the time of Mr. Smith's trial, a sum which Mr. Smith was unable to pay. Mr. Haines, therefore, obtained a personal guarantee against Mr. Smith and the land on which Mr. Smith was situated, for the entire amount due on the loan. This amount was paid out of Mr. Smith's pocket. Mr. Haines had also made the money payable to Mr. Smith in his name, and the agreement of which was to be in writing. He was entitled to the sum of £10 6s. 6d per annum for the remaining period of the loan.

I don't know why you didn't say this in the instructions but if you look at the previous example, you can tell that in both cases you want the sentences to be indented. However, it is up to the students to notice the differences. 
You could say something like: 

We are correcting your texts and are waiting for you to finish the work. Please make sure the sentences are indented and that you are using the correct punctuation for each sentence.

If you have used a dictionary and found an error, make sure you write the word down on your answer sheet before correcting it.
You could also ask a question to the class like

Why did you do it like this? What do you think can be done?

You could give students a few examples. Students could make suggestions, but you shouldn't correct the errors right away and you shouldn't tell them exactly what to do.
The students can do the work in their own time. They could write it down, or they could do it in a file. If you don't want the students to have a file, then you can tell them to do the work on the answer sheet and ask them to write it down before sending it in. 
I suggest you give the students one to three days. It is possible that you can complete the task in one day, but it is harder if you have more than one student. You could also tell them that they could do it faster if they were in a smaller class.

This case was called upon for the first time and the following Court of Justice sat. HONORABLE THE RIGHT HON. E. ROSS, Judge, and Justice S. H. HANSLEY. The plaintiff, John A. Tredgold, of Wellesbourne, N. S. A. C. G. R., commenced a claim in behalf of George B. Turner, of Wellesbourne, against Wellesbourne Livery Company for goods sold and delivered. Mr Justice HANSLEY appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. Mr Justice CROCKER appeared on behalf of the defendant. The Court resumed its sitting. Mr Justice ROSS spoke on behalf of the Court, and made the following observations:-The whole case is an interesting one to-day. The defendants, who may possibly be of the same name as the plaintiff, have taken the matter up by the action of their friends Mr Turner and Mr Lydgate. They will have a great many friends in this Court. I do not expect to see anything of the kind again. The present Court will have no difficulty in deciding the question in my judgment. The action commenced about the middle of last year and the complaint is made, that Mr Turner sold the goods at a lower price to Mr Lydgate than the price charged by Mr Turner. Mr Turner was accused of being a cheat, but Mr Lydgate was not accused of being a cheat. Mr Lydgate was a general salesman. The whole action arose out of the sale of two horses. They have been said to have sold the horses a few days apart. But no man has ever been accused of being a cheat in a case of this kind. There were several things about the whole case. The first was the fact that the horses were sold to Mr Turner by a man called Mr Lydgate who was not connected with the case.",0.9466666666666668,0.2514743049705139,-0.7343581285522741,BLOOM-3B,prompt_basic_02,zero-shot,80-99%,80-99%,99-100%,-0.7860471147722956,Negative Improvement,13922000 year 1893 type Article title The Sydney Morn aid 13922000,,,results-overproof-bigscience-bloom-3b.jsonl

(Before the Honourable Mr Justice MacPherson, for the District of New South Wales, and the Honourable Mr Justice King, for the District of Queensland). -ROBERTS V. LONDON, RICHARDSON V. MANSERV, and MARTIN V. ALLEN were tried on Tuesday, before Mr Justice MacPherson, in the Court of Criminal Sessions at Parramatta, and were found guilty of the murder of Wm. C. Roberts, of Paddington. The sentence was death. The Court also found Robert Richardson, Henry Robinson, and Charles Martin, guilty of the murder of Thomas Mason, of George-street, Parramatta, and of assisting the said murder, and the sentence was death. The trial of the three prisoners had been continued until to-day. A few minutes after nine the prisoners were brought into the Court, and it was the first time since their imprisonment that they had been seen in public. They wore cuffs round their arms, and black coats over their shoulders. When they had been taken up to the bar the Court was thrown into a profound silence, and the three prisoners, the same as in their last trial, were taken into custody. -At 9.30 the Court was again crowded, and the attention of the crowded Court, and of the vast assemblage of spectators, was attracted by the entrance of George Mitchell, and by the examination which he made of John Latham, who is one of the prosecution witnesses. George Mitchell and Latham left the Court together, the Court being again thrown into a profound silence, and the prisoners were again taken up to the bar. During the examination Latham gave the names of four persons who had seen Mitchell after the robbery of the stage. Mitchell said, he had met George Mitchell twice; once he had spoken to him for five or six minutes, and the second time for seven minutes. After he had been examined Latham was taken up into custody and taken to the Police-station. The prisoner Mitchell and the three others were then taken up, and in the absence of the Court were again taken into custody and taken to the police-station. At 9.45 Mr Justice King returned, and the three prisoners were again taken up into custody, and the trial was adjourned until to-morrow morning at 10. 30. Mr J. S. Treloar was in attendance in the Court as solicitor for the prosecution. The Attorney General, Mr H. B. Willis, also appeared.

Risley v WHEREAS Bigge asked in 1827 that plural voting in the selection of members of Parliament should be allowed; WHEREAS this request was rejected then; Whereas the country has sixty years * experience of the disadvantageous effects of our parliamentary voting which was established previosuly to the Australian Colonies being federated; WHEREAS in 1880 small political inequalities in the twelve colonies ha^ve led to substantial injustice; Now this petition of the Australians Citizens' League being in the same spirit that governed Bigge's action, but with far more evidence to support its claims, WE, THE UNDERSIGNED PETITIONERS, DO THEREFORE CALLED UPON THE FEDERATED PARLIA^ MENT OF AUSTRALIA TO CONSIDER THE NEW PROPOSALS MADE BY THIS CITIZENS' LEAGUE TO CORRECT THE MISTAKEN WAYS AND INSTITUTIONS OF PAST GENERATIONS.
 IN SUGGESTING AND LEGISLATING FOR SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS NOW FACING US; The action proposed is: Major Constitutional changes: Election or appointment of two or more as opposed to one representative for each electorate; Election or appointment of two or more electors to vote as individuals in the constituency where they reside, not by party lists; Transfer to the EXECUTIVE of all law making authority; The vesting of sole power to make all legislation, which is no longer constitutional, in the People themselves, operating through personal communica­tion, petitions, referenda and Parliamentary committees.
